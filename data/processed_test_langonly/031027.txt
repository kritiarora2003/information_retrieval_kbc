Background
[1]
: The Applicants are Alberta corporations who carry on mining exploration activities in British Columbia. The Applicants did a review of their taxation matters and became aware of a mining exploration tax credit (the "METC") under s. 25.1 of the
Income Tax Act
, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 215 (the "
"). The Applicants applied for the METC on November 30, 2004 in respect of the taxation years 1998, 1999 and 2000.
[2]
Under s. 25.1 of
, the application for the METC is to be filed with the tax return for the application taxation year, and under s. 25.1(7) of said
applicants are not entitled for the METC unless the documents are filed within 36 months of the taxation year. The Applicants in this case failed to meet either requirement.
[3]
The federal government of Canada and the province of British Columbia ("BC") made an agreement authorized under both the
Income Tax Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th supplement) (the "
") and the
pursuant to which the Canada Revenue Agency ("CRA") collects provincial income tax on behalf of BC.
[4]
This application arises from a ruling of the Respondent (in this application also referred to as the federal Minister, the CRA, or the Minister of National Revenue) dated February 16, 2005, under signature of one Gy Karan, that stated that the request for a waiver:
a) in respect the 1998 and 1999 taxation year returns were beyond the three-year period for reassessment and were therefore denied; and
b) in respect of the 2000 taxation year was granted, subject to audit that the taxpayers were "eligible taxpayers" and the expenses were "qualified mining exploration expenses".
This decision was based on an exercise of the discretion set out in s. 220(2.1) of the
(which is incorporated into the
by virtue of s. 47(1) of the
). The decision was subject to two conditions:
(1) the Applicants were "eligible taxpayers" and
(2) the expenses were "qualified mining exploration expenses".
[5]
In a letter dated May 27, 2005, Ms. Paula Fuerst, on behalf of CRA, informed the Applicants that the waiver was retracted as Mr. Karan "was not aware that the Vancouver TSO is administering the 'METC' and Calgary TSO did not have the authority to make decisions in this regard".
[6]
The Applicants are now seeking an order of mandamus compelling CRA to comply with the decision dated February 16, 2005 whereby the Applicants' request for a waiver was granted with respect to the 2000 taxation year. No action was taken with respect to the 1998 and 1999 taxation years.
The pleadings of both sides cover many issues. However, by counsels' own admissions, the pleadings are largely not relevant to the argument that was advanced before me. The application before me was only argued on the following two issues:
"Was the Respondent's assumption of jurisdiction over the Applicants' request to waive the filing of the METC documents correct in law, in light of:
1) the statutory stipulation in s. 25.1(9) of the
reserving certain authority to the BC Minister; and
2) the prescribed time limit set out in s. 25.1(7) of the
Statutory Provisions
[8]
The relevant BC statutory provisions are ss. 1(1), 1(7), 1(8.1), 25.1, 47, and 69 of the
which for convenience are set out in Annex 1.
[9]
The relevant federal statutory provisions are ss. 220(2.01), 220(2.1) and 248(1) of the
which for convenience are set out in Annex 2.
It is undisputed that Canada and BC entered into a collection agreement regarding collection of provincial income taxes on January 26, 1962 and which is still in force (the "Collection Agreement"). Under the Collection Agreement, CRA will administer the
on behalf of the province. Sections 10(1) to (4) of the Collection Agreement provide the following:
"10(1) The Minister of National Revenue, the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation and other officials of the Taxation Division of the Department of National Revenue of Canada will administer the provincial act for and on behalf of the Province.
"(2) The Province will, during the term of this agreement, ensure that the Minister of National Revenue and the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation
have and may exercise all the powers of the Provincial Minister under the provincial act
and that officials of the Taxation Division of the Department of National Revenue have and may exercise like powers under the provincial act as they are given under the federal act.
"(3) Where it is requested by the Minister of National Revenue to assist in the administration of the provincial act, the Province will provide to the Minister of National Revenue information that it may have
(a) relating to any person liable to tax under the provincial act, and
(b) relating to real property valuations and transactions.
"(4)
The Province will accept as final and binding all assessments, decisions and other steps made or taken by the Minister of National Revenue
and officials of the Taxation Division of his Department under the provincial act in pursuance of this agreement." (Underlining added)
[11]
In addition, ss. 69(3)and 69(4) of the
"69(3) If a collection agreement is entered into, the federal minister, on behalf of or as agent for the Provincial minister,
is authorized to use all the powers, to perform all the duties and to exercise any discretion that the Provincial minister or the deputy Provincial minister has under this Act
, including the discretion to refuse to permit the production in judicial or other proceedings in British Columbia of any document that it is not, in the opinion of the federal minister, in the interests of public policy to produce.
"69(4) If a collection agreement is entered into, the Commissioner of Customs and Revenue may
(a) use all the powers, perform the duties and exercise any discretion that the federal minister has under subsection (3) or otherwise under this Act, and
(b) designate officers of his or her agency to carry out functions, duties and powers similar to those that are exercised by them on his or her behalf under the federal Act." (Underlining added)
[12]
Section 220(2.1) of the
gives the federal Minister, i.e. CRA, the power to waive any requirement to file a prescribed form, receipt or other document, or prescribed information. Section 47(1) of the
specifically provides that ss. 220(2) to 220(7) of the
apply for the purposes of the
. Thus, CRA, for the purposes of administering the
, has the power to waive requirements for a prescribed form, receipt or other document or prescribed information.
[13]
The issue therefore is whether there are some statutory limitations in the
regarding the METC which restrict the ability of CRA to exercise the powers to waive requirements as described in the previous paragraph.
[14]
The Respondent points to s. 69(5)(c) of the
which provides:
"Despite subsection (3), the federal Minister is not authorized to use, perform or exercise any of the following powers, duties or discretions of the provincial Minister: ... c) respecting the collection and sharing of information under sections ... 25.1(9). ..."
[15]
The Respondent then points to s. 25.1(9) of the
which provides:
"25.1(9) Without limiting any provision of this or any other enactment, the Provincial minister, the federal minister, if a collection agreement is in effect, and the minister responsible for the administration of the Ministry of Energy and Mines Act may
(a) collect any information that is relevant to an application for a tax credit being claimed or already claimed under this section, and
(b) share with each other, in accordance with an information-sharing agreement under s. 65, any information that is relevant to an application for a tax credit being claimed or already claimed under this section."
[16]
The combination of these two sections, in the contention of the Respondent, means that each Minister has to carry out its collection of information duties and may share any information thus obtained. The Respondent bases his contention on the fact that the introductory words of s. 25.1(9) of the
use the word "and" when referring to the three ministers rather than the word "or". Given the use of the word "and", the federal Minister may not exercise the duties of the provincial Minister regarding collection or sharing of information. The section thus prevents the federal Minister from exercising any collection of information duties, in this case a waiver regarding METC, in his capacity as the provincial Minister's surrogate.
[17]
While admittedly ss. 69(5)(c) and 25.1(9) of the
are not easy to reconcile, I cannot accede to this interpretation. I see nothing in s. 25.1(9) of the
that requires each Minister to carry out his/her duties and only then be able to share the information. Rather, I read s. 25.1(9) of the
as an empowering section that allows, but does not force, the collection and sharing of information by each Minister. It is included as an exception under s. 69(5)(c) as it would be illogical to allow the federal Minister (acting on behalf of the provincial Minister) to agree to share information in the provincial minister's name. It would then no longer be sharing, but rather it would mean the federal Minister unilaterally could have access to any information collected by his counterparts. The use of the word "and" merely indicates that all three ministers are authorized, it does not imply the limitations the respondent alleges.
[18]
An examination of the other sections referenced in s. 69(5)(c) of the
further supports this point. These provisions are set out for convenience in Annex 3. They are nearly identical to s. 25.1(9) of the
and all achieve the same result, i.e. that the federal Minister cannot, on behalf of his provincial colleague, agree to share information with himself.
[19]
The Respondent argues, in the alternative, that even if the federal Minister can (on behalf of his provincial colleague) waive the requirement under s. 25.1(6) of the
to file an application for the METC contemporaneously with the taxpayer's return for a given taxation year, he cannot waive the 36 month limitation period under s. 25.1(7) of the
. Any such waiver, in the respondent's view, is patently unreasonable. The officer simply confused the 36 month period for reassessment under s. 150 of the
with the 36 month filing requirement under s. 25.1(7) of the
Quite apart from the fact that the respondent appears to be impugning his own decision or at least seeking judicial review of his own position, I do not believe that this contention has any merit. Section 25.1(7) of the
is not a limitation period regarding entitlement but rather stipulates a requirement as to when information and records regarding a METC application have to be filed. It is thus a filing requirement regarding documents and information. This is precisely the type of requirement that can be waived under s. 220(2.1) of the
and which was specifically incorporated into the
under s. 47(1). Thus it is a requirement that could be waived.
[21]
There is nothing patently unreasonable in the justification that the CRA officer dated in his letter; namely that the waiver should be granted since it falls within the three year period that a reassessment by the minister may be made. In effect he is saying as long as the CRA can reassess the taxpayer can claim additional credits. Thus, this contention of the Respondent also does not succeed.
[22]
The Respondent did not advance any other reasons for opposing the mandamus application. It is well established that where a minister has failed to act in accordance with a prior exercise of his discretion, this alone should be sufficient for an order of mandamus compelling the Minister to comply with his exercise of discretion. (See
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  per Bastarache, J., at para. 117.). Consequently there is no reason why the mandamus should not be granted and accordingly, this application will succeed.
THIS COURT ORDERS that:
1. An order of mandamus is hereby given requiring CRA to comply with the decision of February 16th, 2005 to grant the waiver, including conducting, in a reasonable and timely manner, an audit of the Applicants as contemplated in the said decision;
2. The decision of May 27, 2005 purporting to revoke the waiver dated February 16th, 2005 is hereby set aside; and
3. The Respondent shall pay the Applicants' costs in this application.
Application granted.
