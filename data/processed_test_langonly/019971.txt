[1]
: On April 25, 2006, a Notice of Application was filed under section 55.2 of the
and section 6 of the
Patented Medicines Regulations
, seeking among other relief, an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Apotex for the production of the Apo-lansoprazole capsules. Further, the respondent Apotex, filed a motion to dismiss the above application and by order dated April 10, 2008, the Court (Madam Justice Simpson) granted that motion and dismissed within the same decision, the application under section 55.2 of the
and section 6 of the
Patented Medicines Regulations
, both with costs to the respondent Apotex. The Minister of Health took no position and has not participated in this proceeding.
[2]
It is worthy to note that both the main application and motion to dismiss were scheduled to be heard at a three day hearing to start on March 18, 2008 with a further 3 days scheduled to commence on March 25, 2008. On the first day of hearing, only the motion to dismiss was argued before the Court. The hearing of the application was adjourned to May 21, 2008. Prior to the resumption of the hearing, the Court granted the respondent Apotex's motion to dismiss and dismissed the application.
[3]
Relying on rule 400(3) of the
Federal Courts Rules
, counsel for the applicants argued that there was "nothing inherently complex about this litigation." It is worth noting that Apotex claims that this file was of significant importance as it affected its access to the Canadian market in respect to the Lansoprazole capsules, however in its Bill of Costs, the respondent Apotex claimed the mid or low-range of column III for all taxable services.
Timeliness of motion to dismiss
[4]
One of the contentious issues in this assessment of costs relates to the respondent Apotex's timing of the filing of their motion to dismiss the main application. The applicants filed the originating notice of application seeking an order prohibiting the respondent, the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Apotex regarding the production of the Apo-lansoprazole capsules, on April 25, 2006. It was not until October 4, 2007 that the respondent Apotex filed and served a motion to dismiss this application: seventeen months into the proceeding. Said motion to dismiss was made returnable on November 1, 2007. In the meantime, the applicants filed a motion for an order extending the statutory stay and to adjourn Apotex's motion to dismiss.
[5]
On October 23, 2007, the Court (Madam Prothonotary Tabib) heard the applicants' motion, delivering her order the next day. She dismissed the motion to adjourn and scheduled the respondent Apotex's motion to dismiss along with the application on its merits to take place in Vancouver B.C. on March 18, 2008 for three days and for a further three days beginning on March 25.
[6]
Applicants' counsel argues that in awarding costs, the Assessment Officer should consider that the duration of the proceeding was unnecessarily lengthened by the respondent Apotex in delaying the filing of its motion to dismiss. It is claimed that by not bringing the motion to dismiss in a timely manner, steps such as the filing of experts' affidavits had to be taken by the parties that could have been avoided. Counsel for the applicants argues that such conduct should be reflected in the Assessment Officer's costs award in light of rules 409 and 400(3)(I), "In exercising its discretion, under subsection (1), the Court may consider ... (I) any conduct of a party that tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceeding." It is maintained that the motion to dismiss relied on facts that were known on the date the application was commenced, claiming that the respondent Apotex was aware, as of the date of the Notice of Allegation, of the eligibility issue of the Apo-lansoprazole.
[7]
In her rationale, Madam Prothonotary Tabib deals with the manner the motion to dismiss had been handled as follows:
"... What then of Apotex's decision to file, on October 3, 2007, more than 17 months into the 24 month stay, a motion to dismiss pursuant to paragraph 6(5)(a) of the
Regulations
, based on the same arguments it announced in its NOA, and the same evidence it filed on the merits of the application? As a preliminary comment, Apotex's motion was in my view, not brought in a timely fashion. Apotex has led evidence explaining what caused it to decide to bring that motion when it did, the cause being the order of Justice Hugessen, dated August 29, 2007, upholding the decision of Prothonotary Lafreni√®re to dismiss a similar application on the basis of ineligibility for listing of a patent. That may explain why Apotex felt confident enough about its chances of success to not want to wait anymore for the hearing on the merits, but it in no way explains or justifies why the motion could not - and should not - have been brought much, much earlier.
"Still, the mere fact that Apotex, without justification, delayed in bringing this motion for 17 months does not necessarily entitle Abbott to an extension of the statutory stay. One must consider whether, in the circumstances of this case, the mere fact that this motion is brought prevents the timely determination of the application on its merits and, as may be warranted, the issuance of a prohibition order ...
"... Abbott then submits that cross-examinations on the affidavits filed on the merits of the application and the filing of application records ought to be suspended or stayed pending the hearing and determination of Apotex's motion to dismiss, and that this would imperil the dates set aside for the hearing on the merits. However, there is no evidence to support the necessity for a stay of the main application. Abbott accepts that there is no reason in principle for any aspect of the merits of an application to be stayed pending final determination of a motion to dismiss. All cases must be considered on their particular facts and circumstances. Here, Abbott cannot point to any prejudice whatsoever in proceeding on the motion and on the application concurrently, save for the possible waste of time and expenses if it turns out that the application is dismissed on the motion. For this, however, Abbott has recourse in costs. (Indeed, it is Apotex who chose the timing of its motion, and Apotex is specifically urging that the application and motion continue to be prosecuted concurrently). I am therefore satisfied that there is no reason to suspend the prosecution of the main application pending the final determination of the motion to dismiss ...
"... I now turn to the issue of when Apotex's motion is to be heard. Both parties were adamant that the motion has to be heard, not only before the merits of the application but in advance and independently of it. Both parties referred to the recent Court of Appeal's decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the Court stated that the purpose of paragraph 6(5)(a) of the
Regulations
'can be achieved only if the motion is made and dealt with prior to the hearing on the merits of the application' (at par. [36]). While it is most desirable that such a motion be made at the outset of an application, so that it can be dealt with in time for its objective to be met, I do not believe one should interpret the Court of Appeal's reasons in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> to mandate the Court to hear
such a motion before beginning the hearing of an application, regardless of how late the motion is made, and regardless of whether it will be possible to do so before the start of a scheduled hearing of the application. To do so would leave the Court's scheduling at the mercy of the whims of the parties, who could chose to delay bringing such a motion until the eve of a scheduled hearing, forcing the Court to adjourn the hearing so that the motion could be dealt with, possibly even to final appeal. Accordingly, while I accept that such a motion ought, if reasonably possible, be heard and determined before a hearing on the merits, it may be that circumstances will not permit it ...
"... As for costs, Apotex was successful in opposing Abbott's request for a stay of proceedings in the main application and the extension of the 24-month stay. Nevertheless, by the late filing of its motion to strike, with an unrealistic return date on general sittings when a special sitting of one day is clearly required, and without addressing in a satisfactory manner the significant scheduling and procedural issues that arise from its belated motion, Apotex has created immediate difficulties that required, and should have been immediately referred to the attention of the case management team. Abbott's motion achieved that purpose, but in a round-about manner. Much of the reproaches levelled against Apotex were either overstated or irrelevant. Nevertheless, it is not appropriate to assess and allocate by way of costs on this motion all the possible cost consequences of the motion brought by Apotex, nor even of the possible withdrawal of that motion by Apotex. Thus, Abbott shall have its costs of this motion, but in accordance with the middle of column III of the Tariff ..."
[8]
On the timeliness of the motion to dismiss, Madam Prothonotary Tabib clearly states that the applicants could have recourse in costs but also indicates that the timing issue raised should have been referred to the attention of the Case Management Team. The timeliness of the motion to dismiss was brought before Madam Prothonotary Tabib who, in turn, made specific comments regarding Abbott's recourse on costs.
[9]
It appears that Madam Prothonotary Tabib recognized the respondent Apotex's delay in awarding costs to the applicants, despite dismissing their motion. I am of the opinion that the issue of timeliness raised before Madam Tabib once, should have been raised before and decided by Madam Justice Simpson at the March 2008 hearing or later via a motion for directions pursuant to rule 403 of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
Under Item 2 of Tariff B of the
Federal Courts Rules
, the respondent Apotex claims twenty-eight units as assessable services for the preparation and filing of the affidavits of Jane P. Costaris, John Hems, Christopher Gleave, Robert Langer, Harold Hopfenberg and Joanne Frosolone, as well as for the preparation and filing of the responding application record. Assessment Officer Robinson in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Assess. Off.), allowed under Item 2, assessable services for multiple affidavits prepared for the same application. Despite this view, Senior Assessment Officer Stinson in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  held, "The key words in fee item 2 are Preparation ... of all ... respondents' records or materials. The use of the adjective 'all' would embrace the experts' affidavits." In accord with this later opinion and in spite of the obvious work that was put in responding to this application, I conclude that a single Item 2 fee shall be allowed. Therefore, a total of seven units will be allowed under Item 2.
[11]
The claim made under Item 6 for the attendance of first counsel at the hearing before Madam Justice Simpson on March 18, 2008, is allowed as claimed. Taking into consideration that the Court did not provide any directions allowing fees for second counsel, the claim for second counsel is disallowed: see
In keeping with article 2(2) of Tariff B: "On an assessment, an assessment officer shall not allocate to a service a number of units that includes a fraction," Item 13 (counsel fee for preparation of hearing) will be allowed at four units regardless of the three and one half units claimed.
[13]
Under Item 24 (travel by counsel), the respondent Apotex claims three units for each counsel (first and second) to attend the hearing in Vancouver, B.C. on March 18, 2008. In the decision of
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), Assessment Officer Robinson reviewed at length the state of the jurisprudence on the topic of the discretion of the Court within the meaning of Item 24. In accordance with his conclusion that the wording of Item 24 calls for explicit directions from the Court and in view of the fact that the Court did not provide any specific direction for travel fees, I disallow the claim made under Item 24.
[14]
Compensation for the preparation of a compendium has been requested by the respondent Apotex under Item 27. In their written submissions on costs, the applicants are right to affirm that such materials was never required to be placed before the Court. Nevertheless, the Court in her order of April 10, 2008 reflected that: "And upon reviewing the material filed including compendia from both parties which I found most helpful, experts' reports, memoranda of fact and law and bound and recent authorities." The compendium is a document that is more likely to be used in large files and as in this case, has been appreciated by the Court in many other substantial files. The compendium is not a pleading within the meaning of Items 2 or 15 of the Tariff but a summary of the documentation already in the Court file and organized for the better use of the Court. Since this service is not addressed by the Tariff and was considered useful by the Court, I will allow two units under Item 27. Item 27(b) for the preparation of the Bill of Costs is allowed as claimed but under Item 26. Items 5 (preparation and filing of a motion) and 25 (services after judgment) are allowed as claimed, at 5 and 1 units respectively.
In assessing disbursements, the Assessment Officer's role is to determine if costs were incurred, and once this has been established, whether the costs were reasonable and necessary. In the course of the hearing of this assessment, it was conceded that there was not much dispute that costs were incurred during this process. The contentious issue regards their reasonableness and necessity. In argument, reference was made to rule 1(4) of Tariff B, "No disbursements, others than fees paid to the Registry, shall be assessed or allowed under this Tariff unless it is reasonable and it is established by affidavit or by the solicitor appearing on the assessment that the disbursement was made or is payable by the party." This rule is unambiguous: only the fact that disbursements were made and payable can be established by way of affidavit or by solicitors appearing, not their reasonableness.
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (A.O.)) addressed that issue at paragraph 64:
"
(decided December 21, 1979) addressed fact evidence and at pages 781-782 agreed with case law referencing
that there can be no general or absolute rule of evidence in the absence of cross-examination. John Sopinka et al.,
The Law of Evidence in Canada
, 2nd Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999), pp. 954-956, at 16.146-16.148, addressed various authorities and agreed. I note and agree with the taxing officer's assertion in paragraph 20 of
that he was not bound by 'a general affirmation on the reasonableness of the fees and disbursements made by one of the counsel, whatever the context in which it was made' and that reasonableness 'in the context of an assessment is the domain of the Taxing Officer' (there arising out of correspondence between opposing counsel). Having accepted prima facie that the costs were incurred, I must determine the reasonableness and necessity of the various items of costs and allow, reduce or disallow each as I find appropriate."
[16]
The affidavit establishing costs in this case brings less than absolute proof. In
(previously cited), Senior Assessment Officer Stinson stated:
"However, that is not to suggest that litigants can get by without any evidence by relying on the discretion and experience of the assessment officer. The proof here was less than absolute, but I think there is sufficient material in the respective records of the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal for me to gauge the effort and associated costs required to reasonably and adequately litigate Apotex's position. A lack of details makes it difficult to confirm whether the most efficient approach was indeed used or that there were no errors in instructions, as for example occurred in
, requiring remedial work. A paucity of evidence for the circumstances underlying each expenditure make it difficult for the respondent on the assessment of costs and the assessment officer to be satisfied that each expenditure was incurred further to reasonable necessity. The less that evidence is available, the more that the assessing party is bound up in the assessment officer's discretion, the exercise of which should be conservative, with a view to the sense of austerity which should pervade costs, to preclude prejudice to the payer of costs. However, real expenditures are needed to advance litigation: a result of zero dollars at assessment would be absurd."
[17]
The affidavit of Andrew R. Brodkin and exhibits attached, sworn on November 17, 2008, although succinct, is the only evidence presented that the disbursements were made. Said affidavit brought evidence that the other side could have rebutted. Since they have not taken that opportunity, the role of the Assessment Officer is now to establish reasonableness and necessity on all challenged items on the face of the evidence on file.
The respondent Apotex retained the services of four experts to prepare three affidavits tendering evidence on different aspects of this case. One of these experts, Jane P. Costaris signed an affidavit on April 23, 2007 providing technical expertise in her assessment of the term "manufacturer" specified on Form IV submitted to Health Canada. The applicants' opinion on this affidavit is that it supported an argument that had nothing to do with the motion to dismiss and was therefore irrelevant.
[19]
It is acknowledged that Madam Justice Simpson did not refer to this specific affidavit in her decision and upon consultation of the Court record, it is noted that the affidavit of Madam Costaris was discussed in the respondent Apotex's application record and, therefore, was part of the file before the Court on March 18, 2008. Considering the view I expressed regarding costs and the timeliness of the motion to dismiss, I consider that the parties had to be fully prepared to proceed on both the motion to dismiss and the application on its merits on March 18.
[20]
As indicated to me several times during the course of this assessment and established in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  approached from the perspective of hindsight:
"For the sake of clarity I add a postscript. Whether a service is performed or engaged in contemplation of adversarial proceedings in court is essentially a matter of judgment. I have looked for the exercise of judgment, together with prudence, foresight and imagination, in assigning services to the motion in this case as the test of fairness, reasonableness and necessity in applying the guiding principles. It is not appropriate to apply the test of hindsight (20/20 vision) to determine whether a service charged for was an extra service or frill not reasonably necessary to defend the client's position. The time to view the decision to commit services to the project is before the hearing or trial - not on the basis of hindsight which might indicate that as it turned out, the service was unnecessary. In the case at bar, I did not even call on counsel for the defendants yet it was essential that they be fully prepared in case I had done so."
[21]
I am satisfied with the evidence provided regarding the billing of Jane Costaris' services that the disbursement was made and paid by the client and with no other argument from the opposing party on the reasonableness of hours or rates charged, I allow the disbursement as claimed.
In its Bill of Costs, the respondent Apotex claims $54,828.32 for the expert fees of Michael Lipp. Dr. Lipp did not present an affidavit in the course of this matter. The respondent Apotex submits that Dr. Lipp is a Ph.D.; a colleague of Dr. Langer who helped Dr. Langer put his ideas on paper in preparing his expert's affidavit. Dr. Lipp's services would have been retained for provision of functions beyond the expert report, as recognized in the
cases (2007 FC 312 A.O. and (2007), 317 F.T.R. 129; 2007 FC 1035). It is submitted that the nature of the work performed by Dr. Lipp was beyond the ability of Mr. Brodkin as supervisory counsel. Reference was made to the decision of Senior Assessment Officer Stinson in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [2007] F.T.R. Uned. 483 (F.C.), as upheld by Madam Justice Simpson (2008), 324 F.T.R. 188; 2008 FC 278, regarding experts' additional functions and supervising counsel responsibility:
"Experts may provide technical assistance in addition to the work for their own reports and their oral evidence, an area of case preparation beyond the capacity of supervising counsel. However, such work potentially recoverable on full indemnity basis as a function of reasonable necessity should not stray into areas for which supervising counsel bear sole responsibility."
[23]
The applicants submit that Dr. Lipp should not be indemnified as he did not "testify" or provide any affidavit. By analogy, they refer to the decision of Mr. Justice Wetston  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Inc. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 159 F.T.R. 233 (T.D.), on directions to the assessment officer, where in the context of a trial, Glaxo Wellcome Inc. were "not entitled to recover costs for fees and disbursements related to experts not called at trial." Reference is also made to the additional reasons in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where the Court (Mr. Justice Hughes) in dealing with directions regarding the assessment of costs held that:
"I am concerned with what has been increasingly observed as mounting and often extravagant fees charged by expert witnesses. While a party is free to engage a person for expert services and pay whatever fee is negotiated, that fee should not become simply allowable on an assessment. Therefore, such fees should, for assessment purposes, be capped for days spent by the witness in attendance in Court, whether testifying or not, at the lesser of fees actually charged or those charged for daily services to the same client for senior counsel attending at trial."
[24]
The applicants further indicate that there is no evidence regarding Dr. Lipp's qualifications, his expertise or experience. They brought forward the only evidence of his presence on this file, in Mr. Brodkin's affidavit: "Dr. Langer was assisted by his colleague, Dr. Lipp, in the preparation of his affidavit which allowed an efficient use of Dr. Langer's time as well as an opportunity to analyze and confirm the ideas of Dr. Langer. The collaborative effort put forward by Dr. Langer and Dr. Lipp in finalizing Dr. Langer's affidavit minimized the potential confusion in expressing Dr. Langer's opinion. The affidavit was collaborative in a sense that Dr. Langer provided Dr. Lipp his ideas and opinions who in turn expressed them on paper. In my experience, this type of collaboration is common in the drafting of affidavits. Often experts work alongside lawyers and other consultants to finalize this form of affidavit."
[25]
They further cited Andrew Reddon for the applicants, in his affidavit sworn on November 28, 2008: "Prior to the receipt of the affidavit of Mr. Brodkin and Apotex's bill of costs, I was unaware of the role, let alone the existence of Dr. Lipp in this proceeding. I am unaware of any other expert in any other proceeding who has drafted an affidavit (or prepared for a cross-examination) in the "collaborative" manner of Dr. Langer and Dr. Lipp in this proceeding. The collaboration between Dr. Langer and Dr. Lipp clearly did not result in an efficient use of Dr. Langer's time, when it is considered that Dr. Langer still billed for over 100 hours, even by itself an unreasonably high amount, considering the work that was required in this case."
[26]
Considering the lack of evidence on Dr. Lipp's qualifications as expert and the fact that he did not tender an affidavit, the applicants submit that it has not been established that his fees are reasonable.
[27]
As mentioned numerous times by Senior Assessment Officer Stinson, "assessment of costs is, at its best, rough justice". In all cases as in this one, once the expenses have been proven, the services claimed must meet the threshold of necessity and reasonableness. As set in
Engine and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), there is no automatic recovery for costs:
"I should observe at the outset that we are dealing with party-and-party costs. It is well established that parties cannot recover all their costs under that kind of award. Also, compensation of an expert witness during trial at the hourly rate allowed for preparation may be found to be too generous. Further, there is no foundation for the notion that counsel may incur any expert witness costs for which, in the event of success, they will be fully compensated."
[28]
Dr. Michael Lipp, as he is referred to in the affidavit of Andrew Brodkin, did not submit an affidavit and evidence as to his expert qualifications or expertise cannot be found in any of the documentation submitted. As per evidence on file, his services were utilized to assist Dr. Langer in the preparation of his affidavit, "to allow for an efficient use of Dr. Langer's time". As such, through this "collaborative effort", Drs. Lipp and Langer computed one-hundred and sixty-six hours to draft Dr. Langer's affidavit.
[29]
The details of the duties performed are found on the invoices submitted in support of the Bill of Costs:
"
"- Dr. Lipp: Review and analysis of the '548 Patent, the Apotex NOA and 23 Schedule A Documents attached thereto, the Apo-Lanzoprazole and Prevacid photographs, the Biovail decision, the Prevacid Product Insert, the Zegerid Prescribing Information Document, and he (sic) Affidavits of Sonia Atwell, Dr. Levi and Dr. Byrn, discussions with Dr. Langer and Rick Tuzi, Drafting, editing and submission of first Draft Report.
"- Dr. Langer: Review and analysis of the '548 Patent, the Apotex NOA and 23 Schedule A Documents attached thereto, the Apo-Lanzoprazole and Prevacid photographs, the Biovail decision, the Prevacid Product Insert, the Zegerid Prescribing Information Document, and he(sic) Affidavits of Sonia Atwell, Dr. Levi and Dr. Byrn, discussions with Dr. Lipp, Drafting, editing and submission of first Draft Report.
"
"- Dr Lipp: Review of materials, conversion of Draft report into Affidavit form, discussions with Rick Turzi and Bob Langer, editing, finalization and submission of May 04, 2007 Affidavit.
"- Dr. Langer: Review of materials, discussions with Mike Lipp, editing, finalization and submission of May 04, 2007 Affidavit.
"
"- Dr Lipp: Prep for the '548 Deposition (review of Bob's affidavit + all accompanying materials, identification of potential cross-examination questions, etc.)
"- Dr Langer: Prep for the '548 Deposition (review of Bob's affidavit + all accompanying materials, identification of potential cross-examination questions, etc.)"
[30]
In the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decisions previously referred to, Dr. Lipp's services were recognized as compensable but, neither the Assessment Officer nor Mr. Justice Gibson specifically recognized Dr. Lipp as an expert while the Court of Appeal did not comment on that issue.
[31]
I do not question the renown of Dr. Langer, nor does the opposing party. Nevertheless, this established fact does not justify requiring the opposing party to pay for the use of another doctor to draft one's affidavit. Dr. Langer chose to work in a collaborative manner to prepare his affidavit and cross-examination, but based on the principles of reasonableness and partial indemnity, the applicants should not have to pay to uphold such a choice. There is no evidence on file to confirm that Dr. Lipp is an expert, nor that his services were necessary to advance Apotex's position in the matter before the Court. For the above reasons, the disbursements relating to Dr. Lipp will not be allowed.
[32]
I note in passing that the applicants' counsel referred, via supplementary submissions, to the recent decision of the Federal Court in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in which Mr. Justice Hughes, in giving directions with respect to the assessment, stated:
"Further, fees for experts shall be limited to fees for the services only of the experts who attested to affidavits filed by Apotex in this proceeding namely Drs. McClelland, Langer and Cima. No fees are allowed for experts or others who may have been retained by Apotex or by these named experts to assist them."
The respondent Apotex filed the experts' affidavits of Professor Harold Hopfenberg sworn on May 7, 2007 and Dr. Robert S. Langer sworn on May 4, 2007, in response to Abbott Laboratories and TAP Pharmaceuticals' application.
[34]
The respondent Apotex argues that this was a complex matter needing expert witnesses that could provide support and opinions on technical and scientific issues. As well, they argued at length that this assessment should not be dealt with by considering only the preparation for the motion to dismiss and I agreed with that proposition earlier in these reasons. As referred to in their argument in relation to Madame Costaris' affidavit, they suggest that a hindsight approach should not be taken in assessing Professor Hopfenberg's costs.
[35]
I have reviewed the affidavits of Dr. Langer and Professor Hopfenberg. From my reading of those documents, the scope of the assignment for each affidavit are as follows:
: - Review Canadian Patent No. 1,312,548;
i. Review of the Notice of Allegation (NOA) and schedule A to be interpreted as read and understood by a "person of ordinary skill in the art";
ii. Review of the NOA with respect to allegations of non-infringement;
iii. Review and comment on the affidavits of the applicants' experts: Drs. Devy and Byrn
iv. Review of Apotex's Lanzoprazole Master formula
: - Provide comments and opinions concerning the NOA in respect of Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,312,548 (inclusive of schedule  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  non-infringement
vii. Review and comment the affidavits of the applicants' experts: Drs. Byrn and Devi and Sonia Atwell.
[36]
This rough analysis shows that both experts' mandates covered similar issues. However, in reading the documents carefully, it appears that their approaches were different although they arrived at similar results. Without any direction from the Court on this subject, other than the fact that only the affidavit of Professor Hopfenberg was referred to in the reasons for decision, I am not convinced that counsel for Apotex acted out of excess caution in utilizing two different experts to make their case.
[37]
As per evidence on file, Professor Hopfenberg was hired with relatively the same mandate as Dr. Langer, filed an affidavit with the Court roughly the same length as Dr. Langer's and charged a little less than half of Dr. Langer's fees for the preparation of his affidavit. Professor Hopfenberg's billing was never contested by the opposing party. On the contrary, it was utilized by them to benchmark the analysis of both experts. I am satisfied that the fees claimed for his services were incurred. They have not been contested, are reasonable and will be allowed as claimed.
[38]
The exhibits attached to the affidavit of Andrew Brodkin and the applicants' written submissions disclose different US exchange rates throughout. After careful review and consultation of the Bank of Canada website, Professor Hopfenberg's invoice for March 1, 2007 will be allowed at $5,833.07 CDN ($4,980.00 US at 1.1713 exchange rate) and the invoice for May 8, 2007, $21,079.58 CDN ($19,080. US at 1.1048 exchange rate).
According to the respondent Apotex's counsel, Dr. Langer is recognized as one of the most influential experts in the world, the most cited engineer in history. To make that point clear, Dr. Langer's biography was filed as an exhibit to Andrew Brodkin's affidavit. It appears from that document that Dr. Langer is a renowned Institute Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with credentials, distinctions and awards that go far beyond North America. The respondent Apotex claims that they should not be dissuaded from engaging such experts to respond to complex matters and Dr. Langer should be entitled to compensation for the work performed. It is claimed that Dr. Langer spent more hours than the other Apotex experts in this case because of the high standards to which he holds himself.
[40]
The applicants' counsel suggested that no costs should be assessed or in the alternative, the time charged should be reduced by 80%. In support of that argument, they put forth that Dr. Langer's affidavit was repetitive of Professor Hopfenberg's, despite Dr. Langer's reputation. Considering the number of hours charged by Professor Hopfenberg, it is suggested that Dr. Langer should not be assessed more than forty hours, similar to the number of hours billed by Professor Hopfenberg to prepare and draft an affidavit similar in size to Dr. Langer.
[41]
The applicants' counsel also suggested that Dr. Langer's hours spent preparing and drafting the affidavit, be benchmarked as Mr. Justice Gibson did in
"Since I am of the view that Justice Gibson ought not to have intervened it is not necessary to decide whether or not he committed any reversible error in benchmarking Dr Langer's allowable hours on the basis that he did."
[42]
The applicants' position is that although the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, it did not specifically reject the benchmarking principle for experts' hours as enunciated by Justice Gibson. Apotex's counsel responded that this approach does not take into consideration the different ways that people work, the different mandates faced in a proceeding and how they are approached.
[43]
From the evidence on file, Dr. Langer billed $1,000.00 per hour. Arguing that this hourly rate is excessive and totally out of range in comparison to rates charged by similar experts in Federal Court files, the applicants' counsel suggested that Dr. Langer's hourly rate be benchmarked to close the disparity gap in fees claimed for other experts in this file. An analysis of some Federal Court decisions on costs was prepared by the applicants' counsel, compiling the rates at which experts' fees were assessed for the year 2008. This exercise would suggest that the average rate for experts' fees was roughly $375.00 per hour. In comparison with the $1,000.00 per hour charged by Dr. Langer in this file, they claim that $375.00 per hour would be a reasonable figure since the cases referred to were patent cases including NOC matters similar to the case at hand. In counter-argument, Apotex argues that a fixed principle should not apply. Consideration should be given to the nature of one's expertise, the manner in which a problem faced is approached and/or the differences in the strengths and opinions given.
[44]
Another way put forth by the applicants to approximate the rates is to employ the rates of senior counsel, i.e., the experts should not be paid a rate higher than the senior counsel on file. Applicants' counsel cited two decisions of the Federal Court (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) with regard to this approach. Should this argument be accepted by the Assessment Officer, counsel went further discussing which lawyer from the firm should be considered senior counsel on this file in order to establish the capping rate. Apotex's counsel argued that this way of proceeding has been used by one member of the Federal Court in giving directions on costs and considering that these comments were made by the Court offering directions on specific files, they should not be applied widely.
[45]
Applicants' counsel argues that there is no automatic recovery for costs (
Engine and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) especially for experts' fees. "It might be reasonable for a party to put forward the best expert but unreasonable to pass along all the costs to the unsuccessful party" (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)) and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> )). The affidavit provided in support of the Bill of Costs does not offer any analysis of Dr. Langer's claims and there is nothing in this affidavit to justify the time and money spent, except his reputation. Reference was further made to the fact that Madam Justice Simpson only referred to Professor Hopfenberg's affidavit in her decision and not Dr. Langer's.
[46]
Emphasis was also put by the applicants on the manner the invoicing seemed to have been prepared by Dr. Lipp, not signed by Dr. Langer, repetitive, lacking details regarding the tasks performed and the amount of time spent per task, all this contrary to Professor Hopfenberg's.
[47]
Reference was made to one specific invoice in which both Drs. Lipp and Langer billed forty hours (eighty hours combined) for a cross-examination scheduled to take place on December 10, 2007, which never occurred. In the affidavit of Andrew Reddon in response to the Bill of Costs, it is stated that this cross-examination was confirmed on November 7 and cancelled on November 16. Reasonableness is raised when eighty hours are charged over a nine-day period of time to prepare for a cross-examination due to happen many more days later. In considering Dr. Langer's renowned work, the applicants suggested that spending forty hours in the span of nine days preparing for a cross-examination, due to happen much later, is excessive.
[48]
On this specific invoice, "reserve deposition time" was also charged for the cancellation of the scheduled cross-examination three weeks before it was due to take place. The applicants argue that this advance cancellation fee is completely unreasonable considering the length of time between the two events.
[49]
Applicants' counsel did not cross-examine Mr. Brodkin on his affidavit claiming that the questions they would have needed answers for, dealt with experts' invoices that were sent and dealt with by a different law firm acting for Apotex's counsel in that file. As an alternative, they requested the documents that could substantiate the experts' claims by way of letter. Mr. Reddon's affidavit contains Apotex's letter refusing to provide additional information on the experts' fees claiming that the information was privileged, irrelevant or overreaching. In argument, they propose that the Assessment Officer draws a negative inference from the fact that back-up documentation to establish the time spent existed and was not provided.
[50]
Several factors are found in the jurisprudence and have been put before me to help assess experts' fees. These different manners all seem to provide formulas, the application of which would effectively equalize experts' fees. Considering the different mandates for which experts are called before the Federal Courts and with no specific directions from the Court in this case, I find it difficult to benchmark the hours billed or the rates per hour charged by the experts called to testify. Each expert has an explicit mandate which calls for specific qualifications. In taking the approach of comparing one with the other, we lose sight of the different circumstances of each file.
[51]
The approach consisting of not paying experts a higher rate than the senior counsel on file is quite tempting but considering the variation in legal fees across the country, it may be seen as disproportionately benefiting parties represented by counsel in larger municipalities and it should be applied with careful consideration. Also, I have reviewed the decision of the Court in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ), as submitted by counsel for the applicants subsequent to the hearing. I recognize that fees allowed for one particular expert should not be disproportionately large when compared to the fees charged by another expert. However, in my view and in the circumstances of this case, there is no need to determine whether one of these approaches should be adopted.
[52]
I have read the Notice of Allegation, the experts' affidavits and the memoranda of fact and law for the applicants and the respondent Apotex. In this matter, none of the affiants were ever cross-examined and the case did not proceed to a full hearing. In making her final decision, Madam Justice Simpson could only refer to counsels' arguments and the unchallenged affidavits found on file. The hours claimed for the preparation of Dr. Langer's affidavit are 30% greater than for the hours billed for the preparation of Professor Hopfenberg's affidavit, while dealing with a similar mandate. After considering that the affidavit was prepared with the help of another doctor, and despite the high standard Dr. Langer holds himself to, I am of the opinion that the time taken to prepare the affidavit is excessive. With regards to cross-examination, the only evidence found on file is an invoice that contains no details on preparation, consultation or communication with counsel. After considering this evidence and the timing of the cancellation of the scheduled cross-examination, I am nonetheless convinced that some time must have been necessary for consultation and preparation between counsel and experts on cross-examination, but not the number of hours claimed. The amount claimed for Dr. Langer's expert fees will be reduced to $60,000.00 CDN.
The travel expenses ($4,822.53) claimed for the two counsel for the respondent Apotex to attend the hearing in Vancouver B.C. on March 18, 2008, are allowed despite the fact that I have disallowed Items 24 and 6(b) for second counsel. Given the nature of this court case, I find that the presence of both counsels was essential at the hearing and, the amount reasonable in the circumstances.
[54]
Agents' fees are claimed in the Bill of Costs to recover fees for two explicit tasks: Roys Copier Service (Vancouver) to prepare the respondent Apotex compendium and Smith Katzenstein, Furlow, for corporate searches. The amount claimed for Roys Copier Service was amended at the hearing of this assessment of costs to $451.62. Considering my position on the reasonableness of the use of a compendium (paragraph 6 of these reasons) and the invoice to the client from the lead counsel's law firm attached as exhibit to the affidavit of Andrew Brodkin, I allow the amount as claimed inclusive of GST.
[55]
I accept that the amount of $517.09 was paid to the firm of Smith Katzenstein Furlow as evidenced in exhibit E attached to the affidavit of Andrew Brodkin. The applicants maintain that there is no indication of how the searches made by this professional firm were relevant to the litigation, while the respondent Apotex claims that the purpose of obtaining copies of TAP Pharmaceuticals and TAP Products Inc.'s corporate documents was a live issue on the main application hence the evidence filed by Ms. Costaris responding to matters raised in the Notice of Allegation. According to article 1(4) of Tariff B, the Assessment Officer must be satisfied that the disbursements incurred were reasonably necessary for costs to be allowed. The issue for which the services were retained was never addressed in Court since the main application was never argued. However and as mentioned before, I am of the opinion that the parties had to be fully prepared on both the application to dismiss and the main application, for the hearing before the Court on March 18, 2008. The fact that the main application was dismissed with no further hearing should have a minimal impact on the assessment of costs and the disbursements incurred by the parties to prepare. For that reason, the amount claimed for these agent fees will be allowed $493.78 CDN ($465.22 US at the exchange rate of 1.0614).
[56]
On the respondent Apotex's claim of $12,285.80 for photocopies, it is submitted that the charges were reasonable in the circumstances. Moreover and as evidenced by the exhibits attached to the affidavit in support of the Bill of Costs, these photocopy costs were reimbursed by the client for the actual out-of-pocket costs of the photocopying, as essential to the conduct of the action. The applicants submit that the only evidence supporting the claim for photocopies is found in the 1177 pages of the responding application record. At this point, I would like to refer to the following excerpt from
Diversified Products Corp. and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 41 F.T.R. 227 (T.D.):
"... It is therefore necessary for the party claiming photocopying disbursements to give satisfactory evidence to the Taxing Officer that the photocopying disbursements being claimed was essential for the conduct of the action ... The item of photocopies is an allowable disbursement only if it is essential to the conduct of the action ..."
[57]
As stated by my colleague in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Assess. Off.),
" ...Taxing Officers are often faced with less than exhaustive proof and must be careful, while ensuring that unsuccessful litigants are not burdened with unnecessary or unreasonable costs, to not penalize successful litigants by denial of indemnification when it is apparent that real costs were indeed incurred. This presumes a subjective role for the Taxing Officer in the process of taxation ..."
[58]
Notwithstanding the numerous invoices exhibiting the amounts charged to the client and submitted by the respondent Apotex, I am not convinced that all photocopies charged for were essential to the conduct of the action. It is obvious that actual photocopy expenses were necessary in the conduct of this proceeding and as such, I have examined all the material in the Court file submitted by the respondent for which costs had been awarded to the respondent by the Court and made an approximate calculation of the number of copies needed by the Court and for service. In light of the jurisprudence mentioned above and my calculations, I reduced the amount to $6,200.00 as a reasonable disbursement for photocopy expenses and all associated costs applicable to photocopies.
[59]
The invoices for courier and process server, found in support to the affidavit of Andrew Brodkin, and submitted to the client Apotex for payment reflect precisely the claim in the respondent's Bill of Costs. Nevertheless, I am not convinced that all material served and/or couriered were all associated with proceedings for which costs had been awarded. Without a doubt, those services were utilized, be it to file material with the Court or send material to Vancouver from Toronto for the hearing. Considering the vagueness of the evidence on these claims, I allow $1,400.00 and $400.00 for courier and process server charges.
[60]
The applicants argue that the respondent Apotex should not be permitted to make full recovery of QL Searched/Computer time charges since no details were provided to determine relevance and reasonableness. The respondent Apotex submits that costs for on-line computer research should be allowed since actual disbursements were charged to the client as established in the affidavit in Andrew Brodkin and considering the complexity of the legal issues involved, the costs are reasonable. On the issue of research charges, I share my colleague's views in
"A result of nil dollars at assessment would be absurd given that I think the Respondent's counsel had an obligation to carry out research for the assistance of the Court in resolution of the issues. However, the Applicant is not obligated to pay for the costs of irrelevant research."
[61]
I have had the opportunity to examine the authorities submitted to the Court during the course of this matter along with the invoices attached to Mr. Brodkin's affidavit. I agree that not much relevant information can be retrieved from the billing to the client other than for the approximate time the actual researches were done. With this meagre information, it is not clear to me that all of the research was relevant to the matters that were before the Court and for which costs had been allowed. Therefore, I allow the reduced amounts of $1,850.00 (QL search) and $110.00 (Computer time).
[62]
The disbursements claimed for the parking/cab/mileage ($284.25), the Prior Art ($432.73), the telephones ($170.02), the telecopies ($105.50), the file retrieval ($168.24) and the LPIC Levy ($50.00) as substantiated by affidavit and in counsel's representations, were not contested, considered all charges necessary to the conduct of this matter and will therefore be allowed.
[63]
The respondent Apotex claimed GST on all disbursements in its Bill of Costs. It is not readily apparent from the documents submitted in support of the Bill of Costs whether GST was not included in the amounts claimed. Considering that the bulk of the disbursements relate to experts' fees incurred in the United States, GST should not be claimed for those disbursements, while from the record, the invoice for the Canadian expert fee appears to be inclusive of GST. Given the incomplete evidence and its uncertainty, I have done a GST exclusion calculation as previously done by Senior Assessment Officer Stinson in paragraph 112 of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision (previously cited). The total for allowed disbursements is $106,282.82. From that amount, I have subtracted all experts' claims and expenses for which I suspect, were inclusive of GST. I used a GST rate of 5% to calculate the balance of disbursements.
[64]
The Bill of Costs is allowed for a total amount of $111,251.36.
Assessed accordingly.
