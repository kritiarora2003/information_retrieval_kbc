: The appellant ("Glen-Warren") appeals from the decision of the chairman of the Trade Marks Opposition Board ("the Registrar") rendered June 30, 1989 in which he rejected Glen-Warren's opposition to the April 1983 application for registration of the trademark "Miss Canada" by the respondent Gertex Hosiery Limited ("Hosiery") for use in association with ladies' hosiery and panty hose.
[2]
Glen-Warren and its predecessors in title have used the unregistered trademark "Miss Canada" in association with the sponsorship of a beauty pageant involving contestants from across Canada since 1946. Since 1963, the pageants have been nationally televised.
[3]
On the other hand, Mr. Arpad Gartner of the respondent commenced operations as the sole proprietor of a hosiery business in 1959. He had been in hosiery since as early as 1955. The respondent company was formed in 1967, with its head office at Toronto, Ontario, and began using the trademark "Miss Canada" in 1960.
[4]
Glen-Warren filed a statement of opposition on June 28, 1985 based on two grounds: (a) nonentitlement to registration in that, at the time it was first used, Hosiery's trademark was confusing with its own previously-used trademark and (b) Hosiery's trademark was not distinctive because it did not actually distinguish its wares from the services provided by Glen-Warren.
[5]
In his decision, the Registrar notes that Hosiery had established use of the trademark in association with ladies' hosiery and panty hose "since at least September 2, 1960", the date to be considered for determining its entitlement to registration under s. 16(1) of the Trade Marks Act.
[6]
With respect to Glen-Warren's first ground of opposition, the burden was on the opponent to establish its use of the trademark prior to September 2, 1960. The Registrar found it had not succeeded. From an affidavit filed by Glen-Warren "it would appear that the predecessor in title of the opponent from 1946 to 1963 when rights to the trademark 'Miss Canada' were transferred to Cleo Productions Limited was S. Radcliffe Weaver". The Registrar found that "no evidence has been adduced which would confirm an assignment of whatever trademark rights may have been possessed by S. Radcliffe Weaver to Cleo Productions Limited in 1963". Accordingly, the Registrar rejected Glen-Warren's first ground of opposition.
[7]
At the opening of the hearing of this appeal before me, counsel for Glen-Warren stated that she was unable to locate any such assignment and consequently dropped the first ground of opposition.
[8]
As to the second ground of opposition, the Registrar correctly stated that the legal burden was on Hosiery to establish that its trademark was distinctive of its wares as of the date of the filing of the opposition. He thereafter proceeded to consider all "the surrounding circumstances", including those specifically enumerated under s. 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act.
[9]
Concerning "the inherent distinctiveness" under s. 6(5)(a), he found that the trademark "Miss Canada" as applied to Hosiery's wares possessed "somewhat more inherent distinctiveness" then Glen-Warren's "Miss Canada" trademark as applied to the conducting of a beauty pageant "in which the winner of the pageant would be identified as Miss Canada".
[10]
As to "the length of time the trademarks have been in use" under s. 6(5)(b), the evidence favoured Hosiery, in business since 1960, whereas Glen-Warren could only substantiate use from 1963.
[11]
With reference to "the nature of the wares, services or business" and "trade" under ss. 6(5)(c) and (d), the Registrar found there was "no similarity between the applicant's panty hose and ladies' hosiery and the opponent's services relating to the organization and conducting of beauty pageants". He further considered there was no similarity "in the channels of trade associated with the wares and services of the parties".
[12]
Under s. 6(5)(e), the two trademarks are identical.
[13]
As a further surrounding circumstance, the Registrar considered the submission of Glen-Warren that its trademark "Miss Canada" had become a famous trademark in Canada. He concluded that it was "arguable" as to whether it could be so considered since, according to Glen-Warren, the trademark had been franchised to all the main cities across Canada beginning in 1958: as the trademark was not a registered trademark, and the franchisees were using it, "it is apparent that the opponent's trademark 'Miss Canada' would not distinguish the services of the opponent from those of others".
[14]
The Registrar also considered the evidence of Glen-Warren on actual trademark confusion and attributed little weight to it on the grounds first, that it was hearsay and second, that "there is no evidence that a person purchased the applicant's wares under the mistaken belief that the applicant's wares were sponsored by the opponent or that the applicant had obtained a license (sic) from the opponent to sell "Miss Canada" hosiery or panty hose".
[15]
The Registrar accepted the submission of Hosiery that Glen-Warren's evidence did not establish Glen-Warren had been involved in a pattern of licensing of its trademark over a number of years which might lead the average consumer to conclude that Hosiery's wares had been sold under the sponsorship, or with the approval of Glen-Warren.
[16]
He also noted that Glen-Warren's beauty pageant "is an activity which occurs over a relatively short period of time during the year". Thus, he held that "any activities involving other persons who are using the trademark 'Miss Canada' in relation to beauty pageants is of no consequence insofar as the distinctiveness of the applicant's trademark is concerned". Consequently, he found that Hosiery's trademark "Miss Canada" was distinctive of its wares as of the date of the opposition.
[17]
It is well established that great caution must be exercised by the court before reversing the original decision of a Registrar on purely factual grounds. However, where further evidence is adduced on appeal, the factual situation may be drastically affected [see footnote 1] and the discretion of the court will be totally unfettered by a previous decision of the Registrar [see footnote 2].
[18]
Thus, on the issue of the pattern of licensing, Glen-Warren filed, for the purpose of this appeal, a third affidavit of Elaine Anisman, the general manager of Cleo Productions (a division of Glen-Warren since 1970), wherein she describes the development of commercial associations involving the pageant, the trademark "Miss Canada" and Canadian businesses since the inception of the "Miss Canada" pageant in 1946. The pattern of licensing involving the "Miss Canada" trademark dates back to as early as 1966 and takes many different forms, including product endorsement contracts, personal appearance, donations to the "Miss Canada" scholarship fund and participation in the Regal Awards portion of the pageant broadcasts. Since 1966, Glen-Warren has continued to emphasize the commercial value of the goodwill residing in its trademark and has continued to develop new avenues for involving businesses and products in the pageant. Still according to the affiant, "corporations usually clamour to get Miss Canada to promote their products".
[19]
The third Anisman affidavit explains that as a result of its effort, Glen-Warren has entered into endorsements and sponsorship contracts relating to airline passenger services, meat products, fashion show productions, swimsuits, cosmetics, fitness clubs, clothing stores, jewellery, footwear and ski equipment. Of particular relevance for present purposes, a long association has developed between the Miss Canada pageant and panty hose sponsors. From 1970 to 1989, seven hosiery manufacturers have entered into sponsorship agreements with Glen-Warren and have provided panty hose to pageant contestants. On occasion, Miss Canada pageant winners have also been involved in personal appearances, trade shows, sales meetings, in-store promotions, television commercials, and point of purchase displays on behalf of panty hose manufacturers.
[20]
The affiant concludes that Glen-Warren has recognized the trademark "Miss Canada" is an extremely valuable asset and, to that end, has invested millions of dollars in production costs over the years to protect an improving investment.
[21]
It is settled law that where it is likely the public will assume the applicant's goods are approved, licensed, or sponsored by the opponent so that a state of doubt and uncertainty exists in the minds of the purchasing public, it follows that the trademarks are confusing [see footnote 3].
[22]
In my view, in the case at bar, even if sales of hosiery would not appear at first blush to be related to a beauty pageant, it is likely that consumers might assume the organizers of the Miss Canada pageant had in some way approved, licensed, or sponsored the use of its trademark by a business which markets hosiery under the "Miss Canada" trademark, or that there was some business connection between Hosiery and the Miss Canada pageant [see footnote 4]. Therefore, I must conclude that Hosiery has not discharged the legal burden upon it of etablishing that its trademark "Miss Canada" is really distinctive of its wares [see footnote 5].
[23]
In the instant case, Glen-Warren is in an especially strong position. The additional evidence provided by the third Anisman affidavit establishes it has, over the years, made contractual arrangements with hosiery dealers, with whom Hosiery could be in direct competition, to advertise panty hose using the trademark "Miss Canada" together with their products' names.
[24]
Furthermore, as the Miss Canada pageants have been nationally televised, reaching audiences of up to 3,000,000 viewers in some years, it is more than likely that some of these viewers might associate the sale of women's undergarmets under the trademark "Miss Canada" with the Miss Canada pageant seen on their television screen. In my view, the evidence shows clearly that "Miss Canada" is a famous trademark in association with the pageant that bears its name and therefore entitled to broad protection [see footnote 6].
[25]
Consequently, with all due respect to the Registrar, in view of the additional evidence adduced before this court, I am of the view that, as of the date of the opposition, June 28, 1985, the trademark "Miss Canada" was not distinctive of the wares of Hosiery in that it did not distinguish the hosiery and panty hose in association with which it was used from the wares or services of Glen-Warren. It was therefore likely to create confusion, doubt and uncertainty in the minds of the purchasing public who might well associate Hosiery's wares with the Miss Canada pageant produced by Glen-Warren.
[26]
Thus, the appeal is allowed with costs.
Appeal allowed.
