[translation]: The plaintiff is suing Her Majesty for damages for events which occurred in the summer of 1987 when he was an inmate at the Renous penitentiary in New Brunswick. The prison authorities placed him in administrative segregation for a period of eighty days because of his refusal to take a tuberculosis test. The plaintiff was returned to the general prison population after a writ of habeas corpus was issued. For this segregation, which he considers was unlawful and unjustified, the plaintiff is claiming $24,258, including $18,000 in exemplary damages.
Allegations
[2]
The plaintiff alleges he was "maliciously, unlawfully and wrongfully imprisoned alone in a cell located in the division of that penitentiary reserved for the administrative segregation of inmates, for at least 23 hours out of the 24, on June 22, 1987". As the plaintiff is basing his claim on the tort of false imprisonment at common law, the burden of proof rests on the defendant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Supreme Court said the following at 523:
"The claim being one for damages for false imprisonment, in my opinion, the following short passage from
Halsbury's Laws of England
, Second Edition, volume 33, page 38, correctly states the law:
'The gist of the action of false imprisonment is the mere imprisonment; the plaintiff need not prove that the imprisonment was unlawful or malicious, but establishes a prima facie case if he proves that he was imprisoned by the defendants the onus then lies on the defendant of proving a justification.'"
[3]
The plaintiff argued that this detention in administrative segregation was unlawful and unjustified. For her part, the defendant argued in her defence that the check-up was duly ordered by Dr. Roger Légère, the physician in charge of Atlantic region inmate health care services with Correctional Service Canada, and that he had also ordered a medical quarantine. At the hearing the defendant altered her approach slightly, suggesting that the director Ferguson had ordered the segregation pursuant to s. 40 [see footnote 1] of the
Penitentiary Service Regulations
for the purpose of maintaining order in the institution.
The plaintiff was transferred from Dorchester penitentiary to the Renous institution on March 10, 1987. At that time, it was apparently found that an inmate who had been at the Dorchester penitentiary was suffering from a contagious disease, tuberculosis. On April 7, 1987, Dr. Pierre M. Lavigne, an epidemiologist with the Nova Scotia Department of Health, wrote Dr. Roger Légère to tell him that this case had been discovered in March 1987 (D-2). On receiving this letter Dr. Légère contacted the Dorchester penitentiary authorities for a list of all the prisoners held at Dorchester at the relevant time. He also asked that they identify on this list those whom they thought had been in contact with the contagious inmate. The prisoners so identified were then asked to take the Mantoux test. In May Judith Hazlett, director of the health care centre at this institution, issued a bulletin to prisoners directing them to take the Mantoux test. This test consisted of a subcutaneous injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculin. The plaintiff refused to take this test, as he believed he was allergic to the product. On June 22, he was placed in administrative segregation pursuant to 2.30(1)(a) of the
Penitentiary Service Regulations
. According to the notice of segregation (P-3) which was issued to the plaintiff, the reasons for segregation were as follows: "Medical quarantine. Refused T.B. test". Some days after his segregation and on several occasions thereafter, the plaintiff offered to have his lungs X-rayed, but categorically refused to take the Mantoux test. The plaintiff also filed a grievance to which the director Ferguson replied on July 20, 1987. the relevant part of his reply reads as follows (P-1):
"This situation
is the responsibility not of the prison authorities but of the provincial medical staff
. The laws governing the steps to be taken to prevent and control epidemics indicate the procedure they must follow. The situation being what it is, and knowing of the existence of an active case of tuberculosis, the medical staff is therefore required to administer both the Mantoux test and X-rays to all persons who may have been in direct and/or indirect contact, in order to avoid imposing a quarantine.
"By your repeated refusal, this has become your case.
You are in segregation solely for the reason that you have been placed in quarantine
. Once their procedure is complete, the medical authorities will tell you when we can release you without danger of contamination or simply carrying the disease. They observe very strict standards.
We have no authority over them at this point and can only comply
." (my emphasis)
[5]
The plaintiff took steps to obtain his release. On September 4, 1987, Turnbull, J., of the New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench issued a writ of habeas corpus (P-8) against the prison authorities, and on the following September 8 he ordered (P-9) that the plaintiff's segregation end the following Monday (September 11, 1987). In the meantime the plaintiff was to take a lung X-ray and a saliva test, but there was no longer any question of the Mantoux test. The defendant was also ordered to pay costs, fixed at $300. The plaintiff took the medical tests and they proved negative. In the meantime, he had spent eighty days in administrative segregation.
[6]
As the director Ferguson based his decision to isolate the plaintiff solely on the existence of a medical quarantine and the inmate's refusal to take the test required, and these two requirements were presumably ordered by the medical authorities, we must see what the provincial legislation provides in this regard.
Health Act
[7]
A New Brunswick statute [see footnote 2] provides how the medical authorities are to act when they suspect the existence of a case of tuberculosis in a region. In the division of the statute dealing with disease prevention, s. 25 specifically covers cases of tuberculosis; it reads as follows:
"25(1) A district medical health officer may require any person, resident in the health district for which the district medical health officer is appointed and whom he suspects to be suffering from tuberculosis, to submit to such examination for tuberculosis as the district medical health officer directs.
"25(2) In requiring a person to submit to an examination under this section, the district medical health officer shall serve such person, or in the case of an infant the parent or guardian of the infant, with a notice in writing specifying the nature of the examination required.
"25(3) Any person served with a notice under subsection (2) who fails to carry out any order, or direction, contained therein is guilty of an offence."
Additionally, the powers of a medical health officer are listed in the general provisions of the
. The provisions in s. 19 need to be mentioned:
"19(1) A medical health officer may enter into any house or premises for the purpose of making inquiry and examination with respect to the state of health of a person therein, and may cause any person therein found infected with a contagious or infectious disease to be removed to a hospital or other proper place, but no such removal shall take place unless the person can be removed without danger to life.
"19(2) A medical health officer, or anyone authorized by him, may by order in writing authorize medical practitioner to enter into any house or premises for the purpose of making inquiry and examination with respect to the state of health of a person found therein, and upon the recommendation of that practitioner the medical health officer may cause any person therein found infected with a contagious or infectious disease to be removed as provided in subsection (1).
"19(3) A medical health officer may
(a) enter into any dwelling house, school building, business establishment or other place for the purpose of ascertaining the existence therein of a case of communicable disease,
(b) require any person whom he believes or has reason to believe is affected with a communicable disease to undergo medical examination,
(c) cause to be quarantined the inmates of any dwelling house or other place in which a case of communicable disease exists,
(d) isolate persons affected with communicable diseases ..."
In sum, I conclude from s. 25 of the
that a person presumed to be suffering from tuberculosis, on whom a district medical health officer has served a written notice indicating the nature of the preventive test, must take it or be subject to a penalty. I further conclude from s. 19 of this
that a medical health officer has the power to investigate the state of health of a person wherever he may be found and to cause any person
affected
by a contagious or infectious disease to be removed to a hospital or other proper place. I note that the provision does not mention persons who are suspected of being affected by such a disease. I consider that in the circumstances s. 19(3)(b) is subject to the provisions of s. 25, since a case of tuberculosis is obviously in question. The placing in quarantine and isolation mentioned in s. 19(3)(c) and (d) do not apply in cases where the existence of a communicable disease is suspected, only in cases where that disease has been found to exist.
Findings Of Fact
[8]
Having reviewed the facts of this case in light of the obligations on the medical and prison authorities, I feel I must make the following findings of fact. First, there is no doubt that the plaintiff was placed in administrative segregation for an eighty day period and so deprived of the conditions to which he was entitled, namely those of the general prison population. Second, the defendant did not establish: (1) that the plaintiff's name was on a list of inmates who were at the Dorchester penitentiary at the same time as the contagious inmate, nor most importantly that he had in any way been in contact with the latter; (2) that a written notice issued by a district medical health officer was served on the plaintiff
the decision to isolate him was taken, as the only notice issued by the medical health officer Séguin was not given to him until July 9, 1987 (P-4), and the plaintiff had already been segregated since June 22, 1987; (3) that any order was given to the nurse Judith Hazlett by a medical health officer to issue the bulletin directing prisoners to take the Mantoux test; (4) that the plaintiff was prosecuted (s. 25(3) of the
Health Act
) for refusing to take the Mantoux test; (5) that a quarantine was ordered: on the contrary, it was actually admitted by Dr. Annette Séguin, district medical health officer for the Department of Health, and even by Dr. Roger Légère, that no quarantine order was given.
[9]
As I indicated above, when she issued an administrative segregation notice against the plaintiff, and later in her pleadings, the defendant argued that she acted only on the orders of the medical authorities. At the trial, the defence altered its approach. The director Ferguson contended that he ordered the administrative segregation of the plaintiff to maintain order and discipline in the institution. He referred, in particular, to s. 40 of the
Penitentiary Service Regulations
. That section reads:
"40(1) Where the institutional head is satisfied that
(a) for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution, or
(b) in the best interests of an inmate
it is necessary or desirable that the inmate should be kept from associating with other inmates, he may order the inmate to be dissociated accordingly, but the case of every inmate so dissociated shall be considered, not less than once each month, by the Classification Board for the purpose of recommending to the institutional head whether or not the inmate should return to association with other inmates.
"40(2) An inmate who has been dissociated is not considered under punishment unless he has been sentenced as such and he shall not be deprived of any of his privileges and amenities by reason thereof, except those privileges and amenities that
(a) can only be enjoyed in association with other inmates, or
(b) cannot reasonably be granted having regard to the limitations of the dissociation area and the necessity for the effective operation thereof."
[10]
In this regard I consider that the defendant did not establish that the refusal by the plaintiff to take the Mantoux test - and he would still have had to be legally notified to take it, which was not done - represented a threat to good order and discipline in the institution, and that it was therefore necessary or advisable or advisable to prohibit the plaintiff from associating with other inmates. (As regard to s. 40 of the
Penitentiary Service Regulations
, I should like to note in passing that the notice of segregation (P-3) served on the plaintiff actually refers to s. 2.30(1) of the
Regulations
: that was the old numbering of this provision when the
Regulations
were adopted on March 8, 1962. It was however amended in 1978 and so became s. 40. I cannot accept that in 1987, nine years later, the same forms were being used referring to s. 2.30(1) rather than to s. 40 to inform inmates of their administrative or punitive segregation. For an individual who is deprived of any means of verification, this is a real infringement of his right to at least be able to check by what authority he is to be deprived of his already very limited freedom.)
[11]
For these reasons, I consider that the defendant has not discharged the burden of establishing that the administrative segregation was justified in fact and in law in the circumstances.
That leaves the question of damages. The plaintiff claimed the following damages.
[13]
(a) $958 in legal fees: these are the legal fees which the plaintiff paid his counsel for obtaining the writ of habeas corpus. The plaintiff in fact paid his counsel $1,050, but admitted that the additional $92 related to another bill for fees which had nothing to do with the case at bar. The plaintiff is entitled to be reimbursed for these fees.
[14]
(b) $300 in costs which the defendant was ordered to pay by the judgment of Turnbull, J., of the New Brunswick Superior Court on September 8, 1987, the evidence disclosed that the defendant paid this amount on October 26, 1987 by a cheque drawn to the order of "Thomas Evans in trust", the counsel for the plaintiff at the time, and that the latter had transferred the amount to the plaintiff's account (B-13). At the trial, however, the plaintiff admitted that Mr. Evans allocated this amount to work he had done for him, namely preparing an action in the New Brunswick Supreme Court, an action which was later discontinued. Clearly, the plaintiff was not entitled to this amount, which in any case he had already been paid.
[15]
(c) $5,000 for nonphysical damage resulting from an eighty day period "of unlawful detention in a segregation cell within the Atlantic penitentiary, at least 23 hours out of the 24, from June 22 to September 11, 1987": at the trial the plaintiff spoke of the stress he suffered during his detention due to the fact that he was not being held in administrative segregation for a predetermined period and did not know how long the segregation would last. According to the evidence, at the time he was placed in administrative segregation on June 22, 1987 the plaintiff had barely finished, on the preceding June 14, serving a term of punitive segregation. A few days later, he had appeared before the inmate employment committee and was hoping to secure the position of complaints and grievances representative in the penitentiary. However, it appeared that the committee and the plaintiff did not agree on the wages he would be paid and the fact that (sic) the plaintiff would have to work full days or half-days. In short, nothing was settled and the plaintiff said it was not until January 1988 that he was able to go back to work within the penitentiary. The Court cannot award anything for lost wages as the evidence is insufficient. However, he was placed in segregation from June 22 to September 11, 1987 and suffered a loss of privileges, as he was segregated for 23 hours out of the 24, although the director Ferguson said that administrative segregation does not carry with it as many consequences as punitive segregation. I must accept the testimony of the prisoner, who is undoubtedly in the best position to describe how the days passed and the conditions of detention to which he was subjected. The plaintiff said he was even required, between August 24 and September 11, to remain alone in the recreation yard at the time he was entitled to be there, whereas other inmates in the same position could be in the yard three or four at a time.
[16]
Assessing these damages is not an easy task. The inmate is serving a long term of imprisonment chiefly as the result of two armed robberies he committed in 1973 and 1981. Apart from a short period of freedom in 1975 when he escaped from the Cowansville penitentiary and a period of mandatory supervision in 1981, the plaintiff has been in prison since 1973. He will be eligible for release on mandatory supervision in 1992. He has changed institutions several times and undergone long periods of segregation because of his lack of cooperation and disobedience to penitentiary officials. It must be borne in mind that if he had not been kept in administrative segregation the plaintiff would not have been at liberty like any law-abiding individual, but would still have been an inmate in a penitentiary. For these reasons, I consider that the sum of $800 adequately compensates for the nonphysical damage suffered by him.
[17]
(d) $18,000 as exemplary damages "for the obvious malice and senseless way in which this consequence was imposed on him, citing in support medical legislation which could not apply to the penitentiary situation".
[18]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 8 F.T.R. 250, my brother Muldoon, J., ordered Her Majesty to pay $10,000 exemplary damages to an inmate who at the end of a long sentence was kept in prison forty-three days longer than the time he ought to have served. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal ([1989] 1 F.C. 603; 90 N.R. 5), and the Court thus dismissed the Crown's appeal which argued that the amount awarded as exemplary damages was excessive. The cross-appeal filed by the respondent, who regarded this amount as inadequate, was also dismissed. In this unanimous judgment MacGuigan, J.A., citing Lord Devlin in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (H.L.), noted "that 'outrageous' or 'oppressive' conduct on the part of the Government is quite different from similar conduct by powerful corporations or individuals, and that it is much more serious, 'for the servants of the Government are also the servants of the people and the use of their power must always be subordinate to their duty of service'" (at 615 F.C.). As Muldoon, J., had done at trial, the Court of Appeal judges recognized that the defendant's conduct fell into the category of "oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the Government". I consider that the same is true in the case at bar. The Court further recognized that "malice is not necessary for the existence of 'oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by the servants of the Government'".
[19]
In light of these statements of the law and the analysis of the evidence, I consider employees of the plaintiff (sic) committed oppressive and arbitrary actions justifying an order to pay exemplary damages. It appears that by confining him to administrative segregation the authorities disregarded the plaintiff's rights, taking refuge in an alleged medical quarantine order when they were perfectly well aware that no such order was in effect. No evidence was presented that he was in contact with an infectious or contagious inmate. Though the bulletin issued to prisoners about the Mantoux test mentioned that the test was not conclusive in itself, and that if administered it did not necessarily show a positive reaction, the authorities did not take into account that the plaintiff was prepared to take the alternative test, namely a lung X-ray. On the evidence, this offer was made again several times but refused by the prison authorities, who finally accepted it only when Turnbull, J., rendered his judgment on the application for habeas corpus.
[20]
Another fact which was in evidence at the trial needs to be noted. According to s. 40(1) of the Regulations, reproduced above, "the case of every inmate so dissociated shall be considered, not less than once each month, by the Classification Board for the purpose of recommending to the institutional head whether or not the inmate should return to association with other inmates". The director Ferguson said in his testimony that the plaintiff's case was considered by the Classification Board but that the inmate refused to appear. The plaintiff categorically denied having waived this right. No evidence was submitted for the defence regarding the consideration of this case by the Classification Board in at least July and August 1987, and the Court cannot conclude that any such review took place.
[21]
In light of the circumstances, the plaintiff is entitled to compensation on this head which I feel should be $2,000.
[22]
The plaintiff was not represented by counsel but is entitled to all the costs and disbursements incurred by him.
The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff the sum of $3,758 with interest from the date of service and costs.
Judgment for plaintiff.
