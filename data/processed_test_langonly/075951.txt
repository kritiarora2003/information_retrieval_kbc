O'Reilly, J.
: Mr. Jose Luis Rosado-Sicard is a permanent resident of Canada, but a citizen of the Dominican Republic. Based on several convictions for drug trafficking, the Immigration and Refugee Board found Mr. Rosado-Sicard inadmissible to Canada under s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (relevant enactments are set out in an Annex). The Board ordered Mr. Rosado-Sicard to be deported from Canada, as it was bound to do according to the terms of s. 45(d) of the Act.
[2]
Mr. Rosado-Sicard raised a number of constitutional issues before the Board. The Board determined that it had the jurisdiction to rule on those issues and held that:
1. A deportation order engages the affected person's liberty interests protected under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canda Act (U.K.), 1982, c. 11.
2. The process by which the deportation order is issued does not breach the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7 of the Charter. In particular, the absence of a hearing at which all the circumstances of the case could be evaluated does not violate s. 7.
3. The applicable provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act are not overly broad.
4. The provisions of the Act do not violate international law, in particular, articles 13 and 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
[3]
Mr. Rosado-Sicard argues that the Board erred when it concluded that the process leading to the deportation order against him does not offend the Charter or international law. He asks me to overturn the Board's decision and order a new hearing.
[4]
However, at the hearing of this application for judicial review, counsel for Mr. Rosado-Sicard conceded that the issues before me had already been decided by my colleague, Mr. Justice Frederick Gibson in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) (QL). Further, Mr. Justice Luc Martineau came to like conclusions in a case dealing with s. 64(2) of the Act in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.) (QL). I have reviewed those decisions, as well as the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) (QL) and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . As I read them, all of those decisions run counter to Mr. Rosado-Sicard's arguments before me.
[5]
I am satisfied, therefore, based on my review of the relevant case law, that the decision of the Board was correct. I need not say more, given that questions of general importance were certified both by Justice Gibson in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and Justice Martineau in Martin, above. I will certify the same questions as were stated by Justice Gibson:
1. Does the issuance of a deportation order pursuant to paragraph 45(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 against a permanent resident of Canada convicted of criminal offences and punished by a term of imprisonment of 2 years or more, and the removal scheme enacted under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for such a person as a whole, engage liberty interests in section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
2. If the answer to the first question is yes, does the statutory scheme enacted under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, including the removal provision of paragraph 45(d), for the deportation of a permanent resident from Canada convicted of a criminal offence and punished by a sentence of two years or more, on the particular facts of this matter, comply with the requirements of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, fundamental justice?
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT IS that:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. The following questions of general importance are certified:
1. Does the issuance of a deportation order pursuant to paragraph 45(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 against a permanent resident of Canada convicted of criminal offences and punished by a term of imprisonment of 2 years or more, and the removal scheme enacted under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for such a person as a whole, engage liberty interests in section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
2. If the answer to the first question is yes, does the statutory scheme enacted under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, including the removal provision of paragraph 45(d), for the deportation of a permanent resident from Canada convicted of a criminal offence and punished by a sentence of two years or more, on the particular facts of this matter, comply with the requirements of section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, fundamental justice?

Decision
45. The Immigration Division, at the conclusion of an admissibility hearing, shall make one of the following decisions:
