: This is an application under section 18.1(4)(a) of the
Federal Courts Act
, RSC, 1985, c F-7 [the Act], for a judicial review of Correctional Service of Canada's [CSC] decision to impose a correctional plan on the Applicant, who is under a long-term supervision order [LTSO], on the basis that the CSC has acted without jurisdiction in attempting to impose a Correctional Plan on the Applicant while knowing it has no legal authority to do so.
[2]
The Applicant submitted this application on the basis that the Respondents erred in law contrary to section 18.1(4)(c) of the Act, when it knew from a previous decision of this Court that it could only act pursuant to a designated proviso.
[3]
The Applicant is further seeking an order prohibiting the CSC from imposing a correctional plan on him pursuant to the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, SC 1992, c 20 [CCRA] generally, and specifically sections 2.1, 4, 15.1, 99.1 and 134.1, and declaring he is not required to utilize the grievance procedure set out in the CCRA, when it is the CSC's authority that is being challenged.
[4]
This application is dismissed for the following reasons.
Facts
[5]
In September of 2003, the Applicant was sentenced to sixteen years of incarceration, reduced to five for time served, and a LTSO, appended to Count 1 of the Indictment, for various sexual offences.
[6]
The Applicant's sentence ended January 19, 2010, and his ten year LTSO commenced that day. The LTSO will expire on October 9, 2022.
[7]
On March 12, 2010, the Applicant left Canada without permission and resumed residency at his home in South Lake Tahoe, California, USA. He volunteered his address to the CSC; his destination was reported to the United States Border Protection Service [USBPS] upon crossing; and the USBPS report was transmitted to the Canadian authorities upon crossing. In addition, his activities were monitored by the South Lake Tahoe Police Department for 18 months at the request of the Crown.
[8]
After 18 months in the United States, Canada sought and obtained the Applicant's extradition. The CSC charged him with three breaches of section 753.3(1) of the
, RSC, 1985, c C-46: leaving Canada without permission, failing to report to the long-term supervisor, and failing to give a change of address.
[9]
On December 21, 2012, the Criminal Code allegations were dismissed without notice to the Applicant.
[10]
While incarcerated for 90 days in Matsqui Institution in British Columbia in early 2013, an updated correctional plan was presented to the Applicant. The Applicant protested this plan and wrote directly to the Commissioner of the CSC in a letter dated March 4, 2013, with a follow up query dated April 22, 2013.
[11]
A representative of the CSC from the communications department responded to the Applicant's above letters on May 14, 2013.
[12]
The Applicant continued to express his disagreement with the CSC's imposition of a correctional plan during meetings with his supervisor, while complying with its requirements.
[13]
A second updated correctional plan was issued on April 11, 2014 (dated April 2, 2014). The Applicant verbally protested this in a meeting with his supervisor on April 17, 2014.
[14]
During a May 9, 2014, meeting with his supervisor, the Applicant tendered a letter taking issue with the CSC's perceived authority to issue a correctional plan.
[15]
On May 13, 2014, the Applicant received an email in response to the May 9, 2014 letter, which acknowledged that the CSC is not authorized pursuant to section 15 of the CCRA, to issue correctional plans to offenders in his circumstances, but they are so authorized under section 4.
[16]
The Applicant requested clarification of the CSC's position as stated in the May 13th email, in a letter dated May 21, 2014.
[17]
The Applicant received an email response on June 5, 2014, which had an Offender Initial Grievance Presentation attached. He did not submit a grievance.
[18]
The CSC sent a further email to the Applicant on June 16, 2014, which did not specifically address his letters of May 9 and 21. It maintained the general authority of the CSC to issue correctional plans.
[19]
The Applicant commenced this application for judicial review on June 26, 2014.
[20]
The decision under review is the decision by CSC to impose a correctional plan on the Applicant after his sentence had been completed, but before his LTSO had been completed.
The issues in the present application are as follows:
A. Is the application procedurally flawed, in that it was commenced out of time and the Applicant has not exhausted alternative remedies available to him?
B. Does the Applicant's parole officer have the authority to impose a correctional plan on the Applicant pursuant to the CCRA? If so, under what authority?
C. If the Applicant's parole officer has the authority to impose a correctional plan on him, was the Officer's impugned update to this plan reasonable?
Standard of Review
[22]
The appropriate standard of review to apply to the first two issues is correctness. Reasonableness is the applicable standard for the third issue (
Relevant Statutory
[23]
The relevant statutory provisions being considered are attached as Appendix A.
The Applicant argues that section 2.1 of the CCRA clearly sets out other sections of the Act which apply to a person under a LTSO, and the list does not include section 15.1, which addresses correctional plans. In their letter dated May 13, 2014, the Respondents referred to section 4(h) of the CCRA, as justification for imposing the contended correctional plan. The Applicant argues that this section is too general to be accepted as lawful authority for such an act.
[25]
Moreover, the Applicant argues that in Part II of the CCRA, section 99.1, like section 2.1, lists sections of the CCRA which apply to offenders under LTSOs and nowhere in this section is there mention of correctional plans. Section 134.1 of the CCRA authorizes the Parole Board of Canada [PBC] to impose conditions listed under section 161.1 of the Regulations on persons subject to a LTSO, but does not mention correctional plans. Further, the PBC has not ordered a correctional plan be imposed on the Applicant.
[26]
The Applicant states that this Court has found that where a section of the CCRA lists other sections which apply to offenders in particular circumstances, this list is to clarify that where it is unclear whether a section would apply to a certain type of offender. Other sections may still apply, but they must be clear by their individual wording that is the case (
Given that sections 2.1 and 99.1 list sections that would otherwise be ambiguous as to whether they apply to offenders with LTSOs, and that section 15.1 dealing with correctional plans is not clear in its own wording as to whether it applies to those under LTSOs, and it is not included in either list, the Applicant argues that it should not be interpreted to apply to the Applicant.
[28]
With regard to the grievance procedure available to offenders, the Applicant argues that the CCRA makes it mandatory for the CSC to develop such a procedure, but does not make it mandatory for offenders to utilize it. While sections 90 and 91 of the CCRA are listed in section 2.1 and thus apply to the Applicant, he emphasizes that it would be inappropriate to require him to complain to the Commissioner about their own behaviour in imposing a correctional plan upon him.
[29]
The Respondents has an affidavit from Marie Hagman to support the position that an offender must pursue a remedy in the grievance procedure before applying for judicial review. She refers to sections 90, 91 and 96(u) of the CCRA, and sections 74 to 82 of the Regulations for justification, but the Applicant again argues nowhere in these sections is the grievance process outlined as a mandatory first step for a complainant.
[30]
The Respondents states that the ability to update correctional plans is consistent with a parole officer's authority to instruct long term offenders. Further, updating correctional plans is consistent with their discretion to provide instructions to assist offenders like the Applicant in meeting the conditions of their release and facilitate rehabilitation and reintegration. It is also consistent with the purpose of LTSOs; they are intended to "enhance the offender's social reintegration but without compromising the protection of society and the victims" (
The Respondents further argues that the Applicant's parole officer reasonably updated the Applicant's correctional plan in April of 2014. Her ability to do so is consistent with the CSC's mandate and reflects the principles that must guide the CSC under the CCRA as outlined above. She reasonably exercised her authority in doing so.
Is the application procedurally flawed?
[32]
The Applicant has clarified in his materials in response to the Respondents's motion to strike that it is the April 2014 update to his correctional plan that he seeks to have reviewed. This challenge to the decision is well outside of the allowable time period of thirty days, under section 18.1(2) of the Act.
[33]
Moreover, even if this limitation period was found not to be operable, the Applicant should have exhausted the CSC grievance procedure before applying for review from this court. I therefore decline to exercise the jurisdiction of this Court on the basis the Applicant has failed to avail himself of an adequate alternative remedy. Absent exceptional circumstances, which is a high threshold to meet, the internal grievance procedure should have been employed (
The CSC grievance procedure is mandated by sections 90 and 91 of the CCRA and exists to deal with complaints of offenders against CSC employees' actions and decisions. Section 2.1 of the CCRA explicitly makes it clear that it applies to offenders subject to LTSOs. While the Applicant admittedly voiced his disagreement with the application of a correctional plan, he never filed a grievance. Further, when a grievance form was provided to him by the CSC, he continued to abstain from taking advantage of the appropriate procedural process (
While I have decided that I should not exercise the Court's discretion to hear this matter, I have nevertheless considered the other issues raised by the Applicant.
Does the Applicant's parole officer have the authority to impose a correctional plan pursuant to the CCRA? If so, under what authority?
[36]
The Applicant's correctional plan was lawfully created pursuant to the Regulations in place at the time of his incarceration. The CCRA authorizes such a plan under section 15.1 of the CCRA. While a section outlining the use of correctional plans is not listed under section 2.1 of the CCRA (which deals with LTSOs), it would be incorrect to interpret that section as exhaustively listing all conditions that an offender under an LTSO can be subject to.
[37]
The Applicant incorrectly argues that no section of the CCRA or Regulations listed in section 2.1 includes mention of correctional plans. Sections 3 and 4 are explicitly listed as applying to those plans under LTSOs. As the Respondents points out, section 4(h) states that among other things, an offender (and it mentions LTSOs), is expected to obey rules and conditions governing LTSOs, "including by participating in programs designed to promote their rehabilitation and reintegration". Further, section 134.2(1) providing for the use of ongoing instructions to offenders subject to long-term supervision orders also applies in support of a broad and flexible discretionary authority to use correctional plans for such offenders under long-term supervision orders ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at paras 40-45).
[38]
Finally, it would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the CCRA, as well as its governing principles, to interpret it to include exhaustive lists of the tools available to the CSC in pursuit of those goals. The Applicant has been charged with offences for which he was sentenced. This sentence involved a LTSO, which is in operation until October 9, 2022. It is available to the CSC to determine how best to deal with the Applicant while he is still under their supervision, including implementation and use of updated correctional plans.
C. Did the parole officer reasonably update the Applicant's correctional plan?
[39]
Determining whether the Applicant's parole officer acted reasonably in updating the Applicant's plan involves consideration of whether or not her decision is consistent with the purpose and principles governing the CSC, outlined in sections 3, 3.1 and 4 of the CCRA. I see no evidence presented by the Applicant that this update is contrary to these provisions. I further see no reason on the record to question the parole officer's decision.
[40]
I find that the Officer reasonably exercised her authority.
[41]
