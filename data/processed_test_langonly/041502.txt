<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He submitted a request for intervention regarding the retroactivity of his promotion. The request for intervention was filed under subsections 21(2) and 31(1) of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act
, R.S.C. (2nd suppl.), c. 8 (the RCMP Act). Adjudicator Coleman, appointed following the request for intervention under the provisions of the
Commissioner's Standing Orders (Dispute Resolution Process for Promotions and Job Requirements)
SOR/2000-141 (Commissioner's Standing Orders), issued a decision on December 28, 2006, dismissing the applicant's request for intervention. This is an application for judicial review of that decision.
Background
[2]
On May 25, 2001, the applicant, who was employed as a constable, applied for the Understudy Program of the Special "I" Section in Montréal, following the publication of Bulletin CMM-492. The purpose of the Bulletin, published on May 15, 2001, was to advertise a "Job Opportunity within the RCMP" for the position of "Regular Member - Special "I" Sections anywhere in Canada, Special "I" Understudy (Cst) - see App. A."
[3]
The applicant's application was accepted on October 9, 2001; the officer in charge of the Staffing and Personnel Section authorized the applicant's lateral transfer to the Special "I" Section in Montréal in the Understudy Program. The applicant began his training on October 16, 2001.
[4]
On February 6, 2002, the applicant filed a grievance under section 31 of the RCMP Act. He contended that he should have been promoted to the rank of corporal on the date he entered the Special "I" Section Understudy Training Program, i.e., October 16, 2001, in accordance with Job Code 1060 which, the applicant says, was in effect at the time of his transfer. Code 1060 states, according to the special requirements or abilities set out therein, that "the promotion will be effective the date of entry into the Technical Services Branch, Special "I" Understudy Technical Installer Program." When the applicant entered the training program, Job Code 3014 was also in effect. According to that code, the position of understudy in Special "I" Sections was designed for the rank of constable. The requirements for this Job Code were still being developed at that time.
[5]
On February 12, 2002, the applicant was advised by an e-mail from the Grievance Registrar that he had not used the correct process to enforce his rights. He was told that the new process for dispute resolution regarding promotions, referred to as "a request for intervention", had been in effect since April 2000. However, the applicant insisted that the grievance continue and be heard by an adjudicator under the former process.
[6]
On September 24, 2002, the Level I adjudicator dismissed the applicant's grievance on the ground that CMM-492 was clear and that the [translation] "advertised positions were at the rank of constable and that the selected candidates had to wait until they successfully completed the Understudy Program and passed the promotion process examinations before being promoted to the rank of corporal."
[7]
The applicant presented the same grievance to the level II adjudicator. Once again, the adjudicator dismissed the grievance on March 29, 2004, on the ground that the applicant did not have standing and that the request for intervention process was the appropriate process to remedy the alleged harm.
[8]
On May 11, 2004, the applicant presented a request for intervention under the Commissioner's Standing Orders. The entire file regarding the February 6, 2002, grievance was included in the request for intervention file that was submitted to Adjudicator Coleman for determination.
[9]
On December 28, 2006, Adjudicator Coleman dismissed the request for intervention on the ground that Bulletin CMM-492 was clearly addressed to constables for positions of constables. Adjudicator Coleman also referred to the applicant's transfer form, which indicates a lateral transfer at the rank of constable.
[10]
On February 15, 2007, the applicant filed an application for judicial review of Adjudicator Coleman's decision.
In his decision of December 28, 2006, Adjudicator Coleman made the following findings:
[translation]
(a) Bulletin CMM-492 was intended to apply to constables;
(b) The fact that Code 1060, which is a code that is applied for the rank of corporal, appeared on all the correspondence is immaterial, despite the existence of Code 3014;
(c) Adjudicator Coleman found that he did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the applicant's tasks were the same as his colleagues who held the rank of corporal;
(d) The applicant failed to establish that he was aggrieved or prejudiced;
(e) Consequently, the applicant did not have standing, and the grievance was dismissed.
The relevant legislation pertaining to the RCMP grievance procedure is the RCMP Act and the Commissioner's Standing Orders. The relevant provisions can be found in the Appendix to this judgment.
The only issue is whether Adjudicator Coleman erred in his decision.
Standard of review
[14]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (set aside on other grounds by (2004), 242 D.L.R. (4th) 529 (F.C.A.)), the Court conducted a pragmatic and functional analysis to determine the appropriate standard of review of an adjudicator's decision dismissing a request to intervene. The Court noted the privative clause in section 25 of the Commissioner's Standing Orders, the special expertise of adjudicators to deal with the issues before them, the broad powers of adjudicators in this regard, and that the issue was a question of fact, not a question of law. Accordingly, the Court found at paragraph 36 that "all of the factors in a pragmatic and functional analysis lead to the conclusion that great deference should be given to the Adjudicator in this matter" and therefore the standard of review is patent unreasonableness (
In this case, the same privative clause applies; the adjudicator, in accordance with the same RCMP policy, must be an officer or senior manager in order to have the expertise pertaining to requirements of positions and the RCMP promotion process; the objectives of the grievance provision and of the RCMP Act are identical; and the issue is essentially a question of fact. Therefore, in this case, I am adopting the pragmatic and functional analysis that was done in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, and the resultant standard of review is patent unreasonableness.
Preliminary issues
[16]
At the hearing, counsel for the respondent asked that the Attorney General of Canada be designated as the respondent since the RCMP is not a legal entity. The applicant did not object and the request was granted.
[17]
The respondent submits that certain documents tendered in evidence that were not before Adjudicator Coleman, in particular, a decision of a Level I adjudicator dated February 8, 2007, concerning the date of a certificate, should not have been included in the court record and should not be considered for purposes of this application for judicial review.
[18]
Since the decision in question was issued more than a month after Adjudicator Coleman's decision, it could not have been before him for purposes of the decision that he made. Accordingly, this evidence will not be considered on the application for judicial review.
[19]
As a preliminary issue, the respondent argues that the 30-day deadline in section 8(1) of the Commissioner's Standing Orders to submit a request for intervention has expired. The respondent submits that the applicant was aware, at the latest by January 8, 2002, of the decision of Sergeant Mario Grégoire to use Job Code 1060, as can be seen on the applicant's request for intervention form dated May 11, 2004. The respondent adds that the applicant knew when the notice of transfer was signed on October 9, 2001, that he had been transferred from a constable position to another constable position. Thus, the request for intervention was filed late and should be dismissed on that ground alone.
[20]
The applicant submits that he did comply with the deadlines in this case since he believed that the grievance process was the correct procedure to follow and, therefore, he was not required to request an extension of time. He says that he was ready to discuss the issue of deadlines at any time and that nobody raised the issue. The applicant notes that Adjudicator Coleman accepted his request for intervention and that he rendered a decision on the substantive issues of the grievance. Furthermore, Adjudicator Coleman did not question his jurisdiction on the basis of non-compliance with deadlines. On the contrary, he explicitly acknowledged [translation] "his authority to determine this request for intervention."
[21]
The documentary evidence indicates that the applicant submitted his request for intervention beyond the 30-day time period prescribed by section 8(1) of the Commissioner's Standing Orders. Section 27(1) provides that an extension of time may be granted in the circumstances set out therein. The applicant did not submit such a request. Notwithstanding the applicant's failure to comply with the prescribed time limits, the issue arose at the hearing as to whether Adjudicator Coleman tacitly extended the time periods by accepting and dealing with the request for intervention. Although the issue was not fully discussed before the Court, I am of the view that the argument as to the extension of time can be raised under the circumstances. In any event, I do not have to dispose of this dispute on the basis of non-compliance with the deadlines because, for the following reasons, I am of the view that the applicant has not demonstrated that Adjudicator Coleman erred in his findings on the substantive issues of the grievance.
Is Adjudicator Coleman's decision patently unreasonable?
[22]
Bulletin CMM-492 dated May 15, 2001, stated that the Staffing and Personnel Section, Central Region, Ottawa, was seeking candidates for the Special "I" Understudy position. The following details about the position are found in Appendix A of the Bulletin:
...
3. Position No. and Rank/Level:
Constable
Promotion to the Corporal rank will be contingent
upon de successful completion of the two years Understudy Program, meeting the prescribed selection criteria and successful completion of the current promotion system. (emphasis added)
[...]
Constable
The applicant admits that he applied for the position after reading Bulletin CMM-492 but argues that, notwithstanding the procedure described in Bulletin CMM-492, Job Code 1060 was used in all the correspondence in his case and therefore should prevail. The applicant quotes the following passage from Job Code 1060 in support of his submissions:
Promotion will be effective the date of entry into the
Technical Services Branch,
Special "I" Understudy Technical Installer Program
.
2. A continuing tour of duty in Special "I" is contingent upon successful completion of the Technical Services Branch, Special "I" Understudy Installer Program (maximum two years) as determined by the policy centre. [Emphasis added.]
Thus, the applicant submits that his promotion to the rank of corporal should have been effective on the date he entered the program. Furthermore, he maintains that Job Code 3014 for the position of understudy in Special "I" Sections already existed, that it was designed for the rank of constable and that this code has appeared in the Career Management Manual since May 24, 2001. The applicant also argues that the procedure set out in Bulletin CMM-492 could not have applied to him because one of the special requirements, set out in section 5.(e)(1) of the Bulletin requires that "Candidates will be required to successfully complete the Special "I" Understudy Orientation Program with a recommendation acknowledging suitability for performing Special "I" duties." According to the applicant, he never took the Special "I" Understudy Orientation Program and never received a recommendation acknowledging his suitability.
[24]
Last, in support of his submissions, the applicant refers to a decision of Adjudicator Tranquilla, rendered October 29, 2006, following a grievance filed by the applicant about a refusal to pay him acting pay. Adjudicator Tranquilla determined that the Job Code that was in effect when the applicant entered the Understudy Training Program, i.e., Code 1060, was the one that should be applied in this matter.
[25]
The respondent contends that Adjudicator Coleman's decision is supported by the evidence in the record, in particular:
(a) The applicant applied for the Understudy Program under Bulletin CMM-492.
(b) Bulletin CMM-492 was addressed to members at the constable level and stated that a promotion would be granted upon successful completion of the program.
(c) The authorization of transfer form indicates a lateral transfer from constable to constable.
(d) The publication of Bulletin CMM-492 nullified the selection criteria in Job Code 1060 because, in particular, it would be illogical to grant promotions to members at the beginning of the program and then remove them if the members failed the training.
(e) All the constables enrolled in the program were transferred under Job Code 1060 and they were corrected (
) for Job Code 3014. That the job code was intended to be a mere formality and not a job offer.
(f) The promotion to the rank of corporal is not retroactive.
[26]
At first glance, with respect to the applicant's submissions about Adjudicator Tranquilla's decision of October 29, 2006, I am of the view that this decision has no impact on this litigation. That decision dealt with a different remedy, a different dispute and different relief sought by the applicant.
[27]
After reviewing the evidence in the record, I am of the view that Adjudicator Coleman did not err in finding that the intention of Bulletin CMM-492 was clear and that this process was directed to constables for constable positions. The memorandum dated June 19, 2002, from Inspector Guay to the officer in charge of the Staffing and Personnel Section, Central Region, explained the use of Job Code 1060 at the time of the transfer. He wrote: [translation] "With respect to Job Code 1060, which was used at the time of the transfers, this is explained by the fact that Job Code 3014 was not known at that time. On that point, I would like to point out that all the constables in the program who were transferred under Job Code 1060 were corrected by Job Code 3014." This explanation is completely logical considering the circumstances. At the time of the transfer, although Job Code 3014 existed, the requirements pertaining to this Job Code were in the process of being developed. I am satisfied that, in this case, the use of Job Code 1060 was intended to be a formality and not a job offer.
[28]
I am also satisfied that Adjudicator Coleman's decision, interpreted as a whole, was based on the evidence. The decision was not made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him. I cannot find that his decision was patently unreasonable.
[29]
For these reasons, the intervention of the Court is not warranted. The application for judicial review will therefore be dismissed.
[30]
The applicant requested that costs not be ordered against him. He explained that he always acted in good faith under the circumstances and that he was only seeking to enforce his rights in filing this application with the Court. Although I can accept that the applicant always acted in good faith, that is not a sufficient reason to grant his request. The respondent will have his costs under the circumstances.
