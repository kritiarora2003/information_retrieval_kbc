: The issues in this interlocutory application are whether solicitor-client privilege attaches to certain documentary material of the respondent and whether other documentary material should remain confidential by reason of ss. 37(1) and 38(1) of the
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, as amended, on the grounds that its disclosure would be injurious to federal-provincial relations and/or international relations [see footnote 1].
Facts
[2]
The applicant is a dealer in logs. On February 27, 1995, the applicant made an application for a federal export permit to export $5.2 million of logs. On April 4, 1995, the applicant made a second application for a federal export permit to export $1,445,080 of logs. On May 15, 1995, Daniel E. Hobson, Director General of the Export and Import Controls Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs ("Minister"), issued a decision refusing the applicant's applications for export permits.
[3]
On August 23, 1995, the applicant filed an application for judicial review of the May 15, 1995 decision (An order extending the time for the judicial review application was made by Teitelbaum, J., on August 16, 1995.) The application asks for orders:
1) quashing the May 15, 1995, decision;
2) that the export permit applications be redecided pursuant to directions given by the court;
3) that the respondent be prohibited from requiring applicants from British Columbia to obtain a favourable ruling from the British Columbia Timber Export Advisory Committee (TEAC) prior to granting an export permit to export logs originating from privately held lands.
[4]
The grounds of the judicial review application are, inter alia;
1) that the Minister improperly fettered his discretion by requiring applicants to obtain TEAC approval in order to obtain federal export permits;
2) that the Minister acted contrary to law by improperly delegating to TEAC his authority to make the decisions as to whether export permits should be issued.
3) that the Minister took into account irrelevant or extraneous considerations in refusing the applicant's application for export permits (in the application this ground was specifically related to whether or not TEAC approval was necessary, but in subsequent written and oral arguments, this ground was expanded to include irrelevant or extraneous considerations generally).
4) that the Minister acted contrary to law by relying upon factors which discriminate against applicants depending upon their province of residence or whether or not they are aboriginal peoples.
[5]
The affidavit of Keith Evans was filed in support of the judicial review application. The applicant's judicial review application had also requested that the Minister send to the court a certified copy of all material that the Minister alleges he relied upon in refusing to grant the applications for export permits.
[6]
On October 5, 1995, Mr. Hobson swore an affidavit responding to Mr. Evans' affidavit. Of relevance to the issues on this interlocutory application for the release of information which is alleged to be subject to solicitor-client privilege or confidential pursuant to the
, are paragraphs 49, 53 and 56 of Mr. Hobson's affidavit.
"49. On April 5, 1995, following consultations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I wrote to the Applicant stating that the Minister had decided he would not consider the applications without the information necessary to obtain the advice of TEAC in the matter. While the Minister has the authority to make such a decision without the recommendation of TEAC, it is within his authority to ask for it before making his decision.
EXHIBIT K.	Memorandum to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of March 21, and my letter to K.F. Evans of April 5, 1995.
. . . . .
"53. On May 2, 1995, in response to the Applicant's April 27, 1995 letter, the Minister, after consultation with his officials, sent a letter to the Applicant confirming that he was not prepared to make a decision in the case without the benefit of a recommendation from TEAC. The Minister further confirmed that, under the
, he had the authority to approve or deny the issuance of export permits for logs.
EXHIBIT N.	Memorandum to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of May 1, 1995, and the Minister's letter to K.F. Evans of May 2, 1995.
. . . . .
"56. The Minister, following consultation with his officials, decided to reject the Applicant's export permits on the basis that the logs were not surplus to domestic needs.
EXHIBIT Q. Memorandum to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of May 9, 1995."
[7]
Exhibits K, N and Q, referred to in paragraphs 49, 53 and 56 constitute the documentary material from which information has been deleted on account of solicitor-client privilege or
confidentiality.
[8]
On October 11, 1995, Mr. Hobson wrote to the Registry of the Court responding to the request of the applicant for the material relied upon by the Minister in making his decision. Specifically, Mr. Hobson states:
"I have been instructed by my counsel that pursuant to rule 1612 of the
Federal Court Rules
, that the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade must file and serve
a certified copy of the material which was used by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in reaching his decisions relevant to the above noted application for Judicial Review.
"Attached is a copy of the material that was forwarded to the Minister of Foreign Affairs in this matter.
Deletions have been made to the documents concerning solicitor-client privilege and sensitive international relations and federal-provincial relations." (emphasis added)
The material which Mr. Hobson forwarded to the court consisted of exhibits K, N and Q. Exhibit K consists of an action memorandum to the Minister recommending, amongst other things, that the Minister return the applicant's applications for export permits on the basis that they are incomplete, and a letter from Mr. Hobson to the applicant carrying out the recommendation. Exhibit N consists of an action memorandum to the Minister recommending that the Minister sign a letter to the applicant advising that the applicant's export permit applications would not be considered without a recommendation from TEAC. The recommended letter is also part of Exhibit N. Exhibit Q consists of an action memorandum to the Minister recommending that export permits be denied to the applicant. It is the decision of May 15, 1995, which is the subject of this judicial review, that carried out this recommendation.
[9]
Exhibits K, N & Q consist of some 26 pages. On 10 of the pages there are 24 deletions of sentences or paragraphs. The blanks are designated as either solicitor-client privilege, international relations and/or federal-provincial relations. Overall, I estimate that approximately 80 to 90 percent of the 26 pages are disclosed and 10 to 20 percent are blanked out. The deletions have been numbered and during the course of argument the pages were numbered. I will refer to these deletions and page numbers in the balance of these reasons.
I turn first to the question of solicitor-client privilege. The action memoranda were not prepared by a solicitor but do reflect legal advice provided by a solicitor, Beverly Anne Chomyn. Without deciding the point, I will assume, for purposes of this application, that solicitor-client privilege may attach to advice or information provided by a solicitor that is incorporated into a document prepared by someone other than a solicitor.
[11]
In an affidavit sworn by Ms. Chomyn she states:
"4. In subsequent numerous meetings and correspondence with my clients I provided legal advice on the administration of the law under the
Export and Import Permits Act
(
). I also provided legal advice with respect to the legal ramifications of various policy considerations under the
. In light of my knowledge that Evans was contemplating a court challenge of the administration of the
, the legal advice I provided was directed at preparing my clients for this anticipated litigation.
[12]
She also states "severed portions identified as solicitor client privilege reflect advice I provided". As I read Ms. Chomyn's affidavit, she is saying that deleted portions designated solicitor-client privilege reflect advice she gave, but she is not saying that her advice was reflected exclusively in the deleted portions. Indeed, it is obvious that much of the disclosed portions of the memoranda also reflect legal advice. For example, on p. 3 of the material, the following reference to legal issues is disclosed:
"In support of its application for an export permit for logs, a British Columbian company is asserting that current law and procedures do not provide authority for the Federal Government to deny a permit for logs from Federal Crown lands. The case raises valid issues of policy and law."
[13]
Of two recommendations, both of which involve legal input, one is disclosed:
"We recommend that you
and (2) return the application for an export permit in the case of K.F. Evans on the basis that it is incomplete."
[14]
On p. 12 of the material, the following appears in the disclosed portion of the documents:
"In his letter of April 27, Mr. Evans has threatened 'to begin to mitigate our losses and take appropriate remedial action if he does not have a response by 8:00 pm Ottawa time May 2. To protect our legal position, we wish to fax the attached letter to Mr. Evans by that time, if you agree."
On p. 12, the first two sentences under the heading "Considerations" are deleted by reason of solicitor-client privilege. The balance of the paragraph beginning with the words "[T]hese include" is fully disclosed. Clearly, there is a linkage between the details that are disclosed and the preamble which is kept confidential, and therefore the disclosed details must reflect the advice of the solicitor. And, at p. 13, disclosed information includes the following:
"As regards legal implications, it is likely that the Department will be challenged on this issue. We fully expect Mr. Evans to pursue some form of legal recourse - perhaps judicial review of our decision making process and seek damages. Evans may claim ... ."
[15]
The disclosure of some legal advice in the documents gives rise to the question of whether there has been a waiver of solicitor-client privilege throughout the document. In this regard, the oft-quoted passage from
Wigmore on Evidence
, McNaughton's Revision (1961), volume VIII, at pp. 635 and 636 is pertinent:
"What constitutes a waiver by implication?
"Judicial decision gives no clear answer to this question. In deciding it, regard must be had to the double elements that are predicated in every waiver, i.e., not only the element of implied intention, but also the element of fairness and consistency. A privileged person would seldom be found to waive, if his intention not to abandon could alone control the situation. There is always also the objective consideration that when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. He cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder. He may elect to withhold or to disclose, but after a certain point his election must remain final."
[16]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), McLaughlin, J. (then of the British Columbia Supreme Court), explains how a partial waiver may result in complete waiver in the following passages at pp. 764, 765 and 766:
"Waiver of privilege is ordinarily established where it is shown that the possessor of the privilege: (1) knows of the existence of the privilege; and (2) voluntarily evinces an intention to waive that privilege. However, waiver may also occur in the absence of an intention to waive, where fairness and consistency so require. Thus waiver of privilege as to part of a communication will be held to be waiver as to the entire communication.
. . . . .
"In the cases where fairness has been held to require implied waiver, there is always some manifestation of a voluntary intention to waive the privilege at least to a limited extent. The law then says that in fairness and consistency it must be entirely waived."
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (S.C.), Finch, J.A., observes that whether a document deals with a single subject matter or not, the court should have regard to whether partial disclosure would mislead either the court or the other litigant.
[17]
Having regard to these authorities, the following considerations are relevant in the case at bar:
1. There has been considerable disclosure of advice or information in the memoranda that could only have come from a solicitor.
2. It appears that the respondent has disclosed portions of the legal advice that he considers innocuous or perhaps beneficial and has kept other information confidential which he apparently considers damaging, see, for example, p. 5 -
3. Some of the information for which solicitor-client privilege is claimed constitute merely statements of existing law. For example, portions of the first paragraph of deletion number 3 on p. 5.
4. In one case, two recommendations are made but only one is disclosed, see p. 3, deletion 1.
5. Some information deleted on the grounds of solicitor-client privilege is disclosed elsewhere in the material. For example, deletion 17 on p. 10 contains information disclosed in the second paragraph on p. 12.
[18]
Perhaps in an effort to be cooperative, the respondent disclosed as much of the solicitor-client advice and information that he considered could be disclosed without damage or embarrassment. Be that as it may, inconsistency has resulted.
[19]
I have considered whether separate subject matters are dealt with such that solicitor-privilege could be asserted over information dealing with one of the distinct subject matters. Counsel for the respondent argued that certain deleted portions of the memoranda pertain to policy considerations as opposed to the legal challenge to the Minister's decision in this case. However, in Ms. Chomyn's affidavit, she says that she "provided legal advice with respect to the legal ramifications of various policy considerations under the
", and that the advice she provided "was directed at preparing my clients for this anticipated litigation". This evidence filed on behalf of the respondent links the advice given respecting the legal ramifications of policy considerations with this litigation.
[20]
In addition, exhibits K, N and Q are relied upon by Mr. Hobson in his affidavit which is filed in opposition to the application for judicial review. They are also provided by Mr. Hobson under rule 1612 as "material which was used by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in reaching his decisions".
[21]
On the material before me, I am unable to conclude that legal advice in respect of policy considerations may be separated from the legal advice pertaining to the challenge to the Minister's decision.
[22]
Would partial disclosure mislead the court or the applicant? The applicant alleges that the Minister's reliance on, or relationship with, TEAC, results in an improper delegation of authority or fettering of his discretion. It is also alleged that the Minister's decision is based on irrelevant or extraneous considerations. Much of the disclosed information refers to the federal relationship with TEAC and the considerations that are taken into account in a decision by the Minister in respect of issuing an export permit. This is apparent on pp. 16 and 17.
[23]
In the information not disclosed on account of solicitor-client privilege, there is also commentary pertaining to these issues. (For example, p. 13, deletion 19.) The inconsistency of disclosing some solicitor-client advice and maintaining confidentiality over other advice both pertaining to the issues raised by the applicant causes me concern. In the circumstances of this case, to ensure that the court and the applicant are not misled, and in the interest of consistency, the respondent must be considered to have waived all rights to solicitor-client privilege.
[24]
I am satisfied that there has been a waiver of privilege of some solicitor-client communication, and that in the circumstances of this case fairness and consistency must result in an entire waiver of the privilege. This is a case in which, as
says, the conduct of the respondent touches a certain point of disclosure at which fairness requires that privilege shall cease whether that is the intended result or not.
[25]
It will therefore be ordered that those deleted portions of the memoranda designated as solicitor-client privilege be disclosed to the applicant.
I now turn to those portions of the memoranda which the respondent claims should remain confidential pursuant to ss. 37(1) and 38(1) of the
. The certificate of Tom A. MacDonald, Director General of the United States Trade and Economic Policy Bureau in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, sets out the reasons for the claims for confidentiality. Paragraph 5 in part, and paragraphs 6 and 7 of the certificate state:
"5. ... The unredacted copy of the documents makes reference to federal-provincial relations and Canada-U.S. discussions related to softwood lumber. The unredacted copy provides background on federal-provincial and international relations aspects relevant to log export policies. The unredacted portions concerning federal-provincial relations and international relations deal with broad policy issues rather than the implementation of the policy in any given case, including that of the Applicant.
"6. Canadian exports of softwood lumber to the United States have been subject to three U.S. countervailing duty investigations affecting billions of dollars in trade over the past ten years. This has led to sensitive inter-governmental negotiations as well as dispute settlement proceedings under Chapter 19 of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. The Canadian and U.S. federal governments, together with the provinces, are currently engaged in a sensitive consultative process with a view to resolving problems related to trade in softwood lumber.
"7. Taking this into account, I certify that to the best of my knowledge the production or disclosure of portions of the documents filed pursuant to r. 1612 of the
Federal Court Rules
would be injurious to the public interest on the following grounds:
a) The disclosure of the information in the paragraphs which have been deleted from the materials filed pursuant to rule 1612 could be prejudicial to Canadian intents in the current sensitive bilateral trade consultations with the United States on softwood lumber, and federal-provincial relations in that regard.
b) The production or disclosure of the information in the documents in question could undermine the integrity of communications, discussions, and deliberations between provinces and the federal Government of Canada on issues with major economic ramifications for Canada.
c) The disclosure of the information in the documents at issue, because of their nature and contents, could be injurious to the public interest in terms of the Canadian government's conduct of international relations, and the general economic interests of Canada as a whole.
[27]
Normally, in cases of claims for confidentiality under the
, the jurisprudence contemplates a two stage process. In the first stage, without inspection of the confidential documents but only on the basis of the certificate and other evidence and argument, the court must weigh the competing public interests (the public interest in disclosure versus the public interest in keeping information immune from disclosure for reasons of harm to federal-provincial or international relations) in order to determine if an apparent case for disclosure has been made out. If the case in favour of disclosure is at least equal to that for immunity from disclosure, the court proceeds to the second stage (examination of the information) in order to determine which public interest is predominant in the particular circumstances. See
Goguen and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at pp. 470-472.
[28]
However, in this case, the
deletions are interwoven with the deletions made on account of solicitor-client privilege which I am bound to consider (see
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 570 (F.C.A.)). Indeed, paragraphs deleted on account of solicitor-client privilege and the
were often on the same pages and, in some cases, solicitor-client privilege and
confidentiality were claimed for intervening sentences in the same paragraph (p. 6, for example). The
deletions could not therefore be practically severed from the portions of the material subject to solicitor-client privilege and inspection of all confidential material was inevitable.
[29]
Even if this were not the case, Mr. MacDonald's certificate, on its own, does not provide sufficient particularity upon which a court could conclude that disclosure of information would result in injury to federal-provincial or international relations. No doubt, softwood lumber negotiations are sensitive matters, but Mr. MacDonald's certificate does not indicate how disclosure of particular information would be harmful to Canadian interests. For example, it does not say, with respect to softwood lumber negotiations, that on a certain page, a negotiating strategy is outlined or a fall-back position is set out. By implication, Mr. MacDonald, in his certificate, asks the court to take it on faith that disclosure of the confidential information would be harmful, simply because in some way or other, it has a relationship to trade in softwood lumber. This certificate does not convince me that the public interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in disclosure. Inspection of the confidential information is therefore necessary in this case.
[30]
With respect to the majority of the
deletions, and in accordance with s. 38(6) of the
, I received ex parte submissions from counsel for the respondent in camera [see footnote 2]. No evidence was submitted ex parte.
[31]
On my review of the material, I find that there can be no harm from disclosure of some of the
deletions. For example, the respondent concedes in the case of deletions #15 and #16 on p. 7, the information is already publicly known. In reviewing the material, I find that what is disclosed on p. 25 covers essentially the same subject matter as what is kept confidential in deletions 4 and 5 on p. 5.
[32]
In the case of the other
deletions, I have carefully considered the confidential information. The information is not self-explanatory of its need for confidentiality. A reading of the confidential information indicates it is not information obtained in surreptitious investigations which might be self-descriptive of its sensitivity nor is it obviously confidential as would be the case with the names of informers. As I previously indicated, it does not indicate a negotiating strategy or fall-back position.
[33]
I do not think a claim for confidentiality may be sustained simply because the information in question has some relationship to a sensitive international consultation. Under ss. 37(1) and 38(1) of the
, the court is called upon to make a determination based on the evidence presented. This is unlike a claim for confidentiality under s. 39(1), involving confidences of the Queen's Privy Council, in which case the court does not look behind the certificate. In construing these provisions of the
, the court in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  concepts involved in the formulation of an objection of that nature are so broad and so vague that, in practice, they leave much room for exaggerations and overstatements, not to mention clear abuses, which it was felt desirable to avoid with every respect for the requirements of the due administration of justice. While a confidence of the Queen's Privy Council, with the precisions given in the
, is readily identifiable, a possible danger to international relations or national security is not so easily capable of being recognized and, as a result, may be feared and evoked somewhat too quickly, albeit in perfect good faith. That is clearly apparent in the field of international relations, but is also true, although to a somewhat lesser degree, in that of national security, and if the possibility of improper use has always been present in the former system, it will, of course, be even more present in the new one where the objection is available not only to ministers but to any person claiming interest.
"The new rule, as I view it, is aimed at thwarting those possible exaggerations, overstatements or abuses by giving the court the authority to examine the information and to declare that the public interest invoked as the basis for objecting to disclose, although related to international relations or national security, is, in any given instance, outweighed in importance by the public interest in requiring disclosure for the due administration of justice."
[34]
The determination the court must make requires, some explanation of the linkage between disclosure of specific information and harm to Canadian interests. That has not been provided in Mr. MacDonald's certificate and is not obvious from the documents.
[35]
Respondent's counsel, at the request of the court, did provide some explanation. It would have been far better, however, for these explanations to have been in the form of a certificate even if, in part, the certificate had to be filed confidentially. On the basis of the explanations given by counsel, my overall observation is that while I cannot absolutely rule out harm to international or federal-provincial relations by some disclosure, the likelihood of such harm, at its highest, is not great. In many cases, the confidential information constitutes observations on existing policies and practices and how they might relate to a legal challenge. From the submissions of counsel, I am inclined to think that much of what is said to be confidential is already publicly known in one form or another. It appears that if anything, disclosure might result in some embarrassment to the respondent but why that embarrassment would harm international or federal-provincial relations is not readily evident. I think what we largely have in this case is exaggeration of the harm to Canadian interests from disclosure which ss. 37(1) and 38(1) of the
were enacted to curtail. I have no reason to think that Mr. MacDonald was not acting in good faith, but with respect, his certificate, in my view, constitutes exaggeration nonetheless.
[36]
On the other hand, there is a public interest in the due administration of justice which would normally require disclosure. The confidential information was considered by the Minister with respect to the decision subject to judicial review, and is contained in the material relied upon by Mr. Hobson in his affidavit resisting the judicial review.
[37]
In an abundance of caution and with some reservation, I am prepared to order that there not be full public disclosure of some information deleted on
grounds. Having regard to the balancing of the public interests, the appropriate course of action in this case is to order disclosure of the
deletions for which I cannot absolutely rule out harm, to counsel for the applicant, and the applicant, on conditions. Counsel are instructed, if possible, to agree on an appropriate form of undertaking as to confidentiality to be signed by counsel for the applicant, and the applicant himself. The undertaking should at least include a provision that the
material should not be disclosed by counsel for the applicant or the applicant, that it should be used for this judicial review only, should not be copied, and that the original documents provided by the respondent should be returned at the conclusion of the judicial review. Any examination relating to this material should be transcribed separately, and the transcript should be subject to the same conditions as the original material. The undertaking should acknowledge that breach could constitute contempt of court which would be dealt with in accordance with the
Rules of Court
. Counsel should submit the undertakings to the court for approval within ten days of the date of the order.
[38]
The order that is issued concurrent with these reasons will specify the information to be disclosed without condition, and the information for which disclosure is subject to condition. If further directions are required, counsel may apply and the court will deal with the matter by way of conference call. The disclosure paragraphs of the order will be stayed until the final date for appeal, and if an appeal is filed, until any superseding order of the Federal Court of Appeal, or until the appeal is withdrawn.
[39]
If time limits previously ordered by the court must be changed in view of this decision, counsel may make application to the court by way of conference call.
[40]
Counsel for the applicant asked for costs of $1,000 inclusive of disbursements. In other circumstances, the applicant having been essentially successful, I would consider such an award of costs reasonable. However, having regard to rule 1618 of the
Federal Court Rules
, I am not satisfied that special reasons exist to justify an award of costs in respect of this interlocutory proceeding in this judicial review. There will be no order as to costs.
Order accordingly.
