Giles, Associate Senior Prothonotary
: The motion before me on Monday, the 26th day of May, 1986 was an application for:
"1. An Order striking out the Statement of Claim on the grounds that it discloses no cause of action. This was amended on consent to be an application for an Order striking out the Amended Statement of Claim for the same reason;
"2. In the alternative, for an Order staying proceedings pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, 2nd Supp., c. 10;
"3. In the further alternative for an Order extending the time for filing the Statement of Defence for a period of 30 days following the final disposition of this Motion."
[2]
At the conclusion of the hearing I indicated for brief oral reasons delivered from the bench that the application to strike out the amended statement of claim would be dismissed and that the application for a stay would be dismissed subject to the defendant's right to bring a further motion at another time. I further indicated that the application for an order extending the time for filing the statement of defence for a period of 30 days following the final disposition of this motion would be granted and that costs would be in the cause.
[3]
After the hearing, counsel asked that I prepare written reasons. I have decided to summarize and perhaps clarify the reasons I delivered from the bench.
[4]
At the hearing counsel pointed out that in deciding whether or not I should strike the amended statement of claim I was obliged to rely on the amended statement of claim and that evidence could not be tendered.
[5]
The amended statement of claim alleges that the lease implies and custom indicates that this lease in fact grants exclusive rights to sell certain kinds of merchandise. Counsel for the defendant alleges that Schedule 1 to the lease (which has been attached to the amended statement of claim and therefore forms part of it) indicates that there cannot be a no competition clause in the lease in that it contemplates competition. I do not agree with counsel's interpretation. Schedule 1 appears to contemplate that there maybe actions which will cause a disagreement with regard to a non-competition clause or a grant of exclusive rights.
[6]
Authority was cited to the effect that it was proper to decide complicated issues in interlocutory proceedings. However, there is no authority and there should not be that complicated issues should be decided with almost none of the necessary facts upon which a determination should be made. The lease itself is not before me. There are allegations with respect to custom and conduct but no detail. I do not propose to determine whether or not the lease agreement in fact does contain by words, implication or otherwise, a grant of exclusive right or a non-competition clause without more evidence before me.
The amended statement of claim contains an allegation of exclusive rights. Schedule 1 is not inconsistent with the existence of such rights. Defendant's counsel alleged that an exclusive right is not enforceable unless a no-competition clause exists in the lease. An exclusive right being alleged any necessary no-completion clause must be presumed. The non-existence of such a clause can only be determined from an inspection of the lease. The amended statement of claim also alleges damages suffered. A right, a breach of it and damages are alleged. A cause of action is therefore disclosed. The application for the amended statement of claim to be struck out will therefore be dismissed.
[7]
With regard to the motion for a stay, it was argued on the basis of the second paragraph of Schedule 1 to the lease that there is a requirement for arbitration. The first two paragraphs of Schedule 1 read as follows:
"PERMISSIBLE ITEMS FOR SALE IN AIR TERMINAL BUILDING SHOPS
"TORONTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
"The following classes of merchandise are the specialties of the shop under which they are listed. The lists are indicative of the type of business which may be transacted in the respective shops, and are not to be considered as being exhaustive lists. The shops may introduce other classes of merchandise which are specialties, or incidentals not incompatible with the type of shop being operated; and the Department will not interfere with the normal business transaction of the shops.
"In stocking the shops with merchandise as specialties and/or incidentals, duplications may result. Any conflict arising between operators of the shops, due to duplications (other than the permissible duplications appearing below), being construed as infringements of specialties as between shops, shall be referred to the Minister; and the decision of the Minister shall be final and binding upon all operators of the shops in the air terminal buildings."
The application of the second paragraph is somewhat obscure. It was argued by plaintiff's counsel that the paragraph indicated that in a dispute between tenants the Minister should be the arbitrator and that his decision should be final. I understood the defendant's submission to be in effect that the action was premature and should be stayed until the issue between tenants had been decided by arbitration with the Minister as arbitrator.
[8]
Any dispute arising from a lease would normally be between the landlord and the tenant. For there to be any right of action between tenants, there would have to be at least something akin to a building scheme or covenant running with the land.
[9]
In an issue between a tenant and the landlord the intention could not be that the Minister be an arbitrator because the sole arbitrator (or the presiding arbitrator of three) must be neutral by definition. The Minister is self-evidently not neutral in a dispute to which Her Majesty the Queen is a party. This application was brought under s. 50(1)(b) of the Federal Court Act not under Rule 319(1)(a). The submission of affidavit evidence is therefore not prohibited. I proposed adjourning the hearing to permit the applicant to file evidence, in particular a copy of the lease. Counsel indicated that he did not wish to submit further evidence. I therefore dismissed the application on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence before me on which I could find an obligation or even a right to arbitrate with other tenants and that the clause could not indicate a requirement for arbitration between the landlord and the tenant with the Minister as arbitrator.
[10]
At the conclusion of the hearing before me in Toronto, counsel for the plaintiff, the respondent to the application, who had come from Ottawa raised informally the matter of the proper place to arrange for motions to be heard. He suggested that the matter was not covered by the Rules of this Court and that I should therefore apply Rule 37.03(2)(a) of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure. That Ontario Rule requires that a motion be made where the solicitor of record of a responding party practices law. It might be that the application of the Ontario Rule would at some stage in this action require the plaintiff's solicitor who is opposing the Crown from a base in Ottawa to make a motion in Toronto where Crown counsel is based. The practice in the Exchequer Court was that motions should be made in the place most convenient for the party opposing the Crown. Rule 5 provides that I must analogize either to another provision of the Rules of this Court or the practice and procedure in force for similar proceedings in the Courts of that Province to which the subject matter of the proceedings most particularly relates. Which ever is most appropriate in the circumstances.
[11]
Rule 483 of this Court provides the method for determining the place of trial. It is apparent from paragraph 4 of that Rule that the convenience of the parties is a factor to be considered in determining the place of a trial or hearing in this court. By analogy to that Rule convenience of the parties must be a factor in determining the place of hearing of a motion. The time within which it is necessary to determine where a motion will be heard is not as long as that available for determining the place of trial. Notice of a motion indicating the place of hearing having been given, there may be as little as two clear days within which to attempt to change the place of hearing. In fact it may not be possible to arrange for an application to change the place of hearing to be heard before the date set, in the notice for hearing the motion. I nevertheless feel that the proper analogy is to Rule 483 and that the place of hearing for a motion should be the place most acceptable or convenient.
[12]
It may be that the sanction indicated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , for failure to pick the most convenient place for hearing correctly will result in an applicant always picking the place of hearing nearest to the place of practice of respondent's counsel (unless the exception in that case applies). Be that as it may I think it important that convenience remain the criterion for determining the place of hearing of motions.
[13]
It should be noted, as it was in the MacKinnon case, that this court will, on informal application to the Registry, arrange to have a motion heard at any convenient place in Canada.
[14]
At the hearing I indicated, as I believe now, wrongly that the applicant should normally be entitled to have a motion heard at the court most convenient for him. Notice of Motion may be filed at the local Registry most convenient for the applicant. The place of hearing should be the place most convenient for all involved. That is to say witnesses, parties, counsel and the court.
The motions applying for orders striking out the statement of claim and amended statement of claim and for a stay are dismissed.
[16]
It is ordered that the time for filing a statement of defence be extended for 30 days after the final disposition of these motions.
Application allowed in part.
