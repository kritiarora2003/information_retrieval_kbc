: The Public Service Commission of Canada (hereinafter referred to as "the Commission") approved certain "transfer exclusion legislation" designed to provide more flexibility for transfers within the Public Service. The plaintiff attacks this order and the amending
Regulations
on the grounds that they are too broad insofar as they deprive too many public servants of an opportunity for advancement based on merit as well as seriously curtailing their right of appeal.
[2]
Two actions were initiated on behalf of the plaintiff seeking a declaration that the
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
and the
Transfer Regulations
(PC 1990-513, SOR 90-81) are contrary to s. 41 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33, and are therefore ultra vires.
[3]
Initially, on June 8, 1989, the Governor-in-Council, acting on the recommendation of the Commission, approved
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
(PC 1989-1093) and the
Transfer Regulations
(SOR 89-305), which came into force June 12, 1989. On July 11, 1989, the Public Service Alliance commenced its first action in this court (Court file no. T-1427-89), seeking a declaration that this order and the accompanying
Regulations
were ultra vires the Governor-in-Council and the Commission.
[4]
Because of the plaintiff's initiative, the defendant revoked this order and the
Regulations
, and on March 15, 1990, approved an amended
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
(PC 1990-513) and
Transfer Regulations
(SOR 90-81). The purpose and intent of the new order and
Regulations
was the same as the ones they replaced, the only difference being that the new order provided "technical precision" lacking in the previous legislation. The Alliance commenced this second action on May 4, 1990. Since the 1989 Order and
Regulations
were expressly revoked, the first action in this matter is now moot, however the issues presented are technically the same. This order reads as follows:
"Public Service Employment Act
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
Transfer Regulations
P.C. 1990-513 - 15 March, 1990
Whereas the Public Service Commission has decided that it is not practicable nor in the best interests of the Public Service
(a) to apply s. 10 of the Public Service Employment Act, in relation to qualifications other than language skills, to any position to which a person is to be or is appointed on an indeterminate basis from within the Public Service and the appointment does not or will not result in a change of tenure or occupational group or subgroup or in an increase in level of the person; and
(b) to apply s. 21 of the Public Service Employment Act to all persons who, but for this order, would have a right to appeal against the appointment or proposed appointment on an indeterminate basis of any person to a position where the appointment does not or will not result in a change of tenure or occupational group or subgroup or in an increase in level of the person;
. . . . .
Therefore, His Excellency the Governor-General-in-Council,
(a) on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, is pleased hereby pursuant to subs. 41(2) of the Public Service Employment Act, to approve the revocation by the Public Service Commission of the order excluding employees, other than employees in the management category, from the operation of s. 10, except to the extent that language skills are a basis of assessment in selections for appointment, and s. 21 of the Public Service Employment Act on their appointment for an indeterminate period where such appointments do not result in a change in tenure or in occupational group or subgroup or in an increase in level of those employees approved by order-in-council P.C. 1989-1903 of June 8, 1989* and in consequence thereof to revoke the said order-incouncil; and is pleased hereby pursuant to subs. 41(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, to make in substitution therefor the annexed order approving the exclusion by the Public Service Commission of certain positions from the operation of s. 10 in relation to qualifications other than language skills, and of certain persons from the operation of s. 21 of the Public Service Employment Act; and
(b) on the recommendation of the Secretary of State and the Public Service Commission is pleased hereby pursuant to subs. 37(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, to revoke the Regulations respecting the appointment of employees, other than employees in the management category, on their appointment for an indeterminate period where such appointments do not result in a change in tenure or occupational group or subgroup or in an increase in level of those employees, P.C. 1989-1903 of June 8, 1989*; and is pleased hereby pursuant to subs. 37(1) of the Public Service Employment Act, to make in substitution therefor the annexed Regulations respecting the appointment or proposed appointment on an indeterminate basis of a person to a position where the appointment does not or will not result ..."
[5]
The effect of this Exclusion Order is described in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement accompanying the order:
"The
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
and
Regulations
exclude certain positions and certain persons from certain provisions of the
Public Service Employment Act
. The purpose of this exclusion is to simplify the approach of moving employees within their occupational group and subgroup, to new positions that are at the same or lower level.
In these instances, these transfers can be made without the appointments being subject to appeal by other employees and without having to demonstrate the relative qualification of one individual over another
. Employees who are transferred must consent to the move and meet the requirements of the position, including the applicable language, medical, security and occupational certification qualifications." (Emphasis added)
[6]
Historically, the merit principle lies at the heart of the
Public Service Employment Act
. The Commission is responsible for staffing the federal Public Service and, in exercising this function, it acts as Parliament's agent in ensuring that the merit principle is upheld.
[7]
Two sections within the legislation were purposely enacted to provide safeguards. Section 10 of the
Public Service Employment Act
, dictates that appointments to or from within the Public Service are to be based on selection according to merit in order that the best qualified and most suitable candidate is selected for appointment. It reads:
"10. Appointments to or from within the Public Service shall be based on selection according to merit, as determined by the Commission, and shall be made by the Commission, at the request of the deputy head concerned, by competition or by such other process of personnel selection designed to establish the merit of candidates as the Commission considers is in the best interests of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applied with respect to any particular appointment a right to appeal. It provides:
"21(1) where a person is appointed or is about to be appointed under this Act and the selection of the person for appointment was made from within the Public Service, every unsuccessful candidate, in the case of selection by closed competition, or, in the case of selection without competition, every person whose opportunity for advancement, in the opinion of the Commission, has been prejudicially affected, may, within such period as the Commission prescribes, appeal against the appointment to a board established by the Commission to conduct an inquiry at which the person appealing and the deputy head concerned, or their representatives, shall be given an opportunity to be heard."
(Note: The Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  made in order to fill a vacancy in a position in the Public Service constitutes an "appointment" within the meaning of the
Public Service Employment Act
.)
[9]
In addition to sections which provide protection for public servants, Parliament also saw fit to allow the Commission certain flexibility and this is achieved through exclusion orders and
Regulations
authorized pursuant to ss. 37 and 41 of the
which read as follows:
"37(1) The Governor-in-Council, on the recommendation of the Commission, may make regulations prescribing how positions or persons, wholly or partly excluded under s. 41, shall be dealt with.
"41(1) In any case where the Commission decides that it is not practicable or in the best interests of the Public Service to apply this Act or any provision thereof to
position or person or class of positions or persons, the Commission may, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, exclude that position or person or class of positions or persons in whole or in part from the operation of this Act.
"41(2) The Commission may, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, reapply any of the provisions of this Act to any position or person excluded pursuant to subs. (1)." (Emphasis added)
[10]
The plaintiff submits that this exclusion order (PC 1990-513) would allow lateral transfers without competition and could ignore the "best qualified" principle and that should a public servant who is either "qualified" or "best qualified" be overlooked, he or she would lose the protection of the safeguards built into the
pursuant to ss. 10 and 21. It is further suggested that the wording of the
is deliberately broad and vague. In light of s. 41, it fails to specifically deleniate "positions" or "persons" or "class of positions" or "persons"; it is in fact an exclusion order providing the Commission with unrestricted discretion.
[11]
Counsel for the defendant took the position that the
was specific and met the test of complying with s. 41 of the
. He argued that statutory interpretation of the word "any" in the context of s. 41 could mean "all" or "every". In support, he suggests that the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), allowed the Commission to exclude any person or position from the application of the
through an exclusion order of general application. He submits that for practical purposes, and for the sake of flexibility, the Commission should be permitted liberal transfer authority since it was in the best interest of the Public Service that this discretion be available.
[12]
I cannot agree with the defendant's position either with respect to flexibility, statutory interpretation or the suggestion that the Court of Appeal permitted the Commission such broad authority in its reasons for judgment in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that in construing a provision of any
of Parliament, regard must be had to the object of the legislation as a whole. If I were to accept the submission that "any" can mean "all" in the context of s. 41, then I would be defeating the whole purpose and object of the
Public Service Employment Act
which is to ensure that appointments to the Public Service are made on the basis of merit. The Commission could then enact one all encompassing exclusion order which could amount to abuse of the merit principle and completely avoid the safeguards which Parliament intended.
[13]
I would now like to refer to what I consider to be the proper analysis of
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  of closed competition for a position in the Public Service classified as "bilingual nonimperative". The relevant provisions of the
Official Languages Exclusion Approval Order
applicable in the case were the following:
"4(1) The following persons are hereby excluded from the operation of s. 10 of the
in so far as a selection standard based on language skills is a basis of assessment in selections for a nonimperative appointment according to merit, namely, persons who qualify in the knowledge and use of one of the official languages at the level of proficiency required for the bilingual position and
who
and submit to the Commission an agreement;
"4(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), a person is eligible for language training for the purposes of a bilingual position if,
(a) he demonstrates to the Commission his potential for attaining the knowledge and use of the other official language at the level of proficiency required for the bilingual position, and
(b) since January 1, 1974, he has received in the aggregate less than the maximum language training time prescribed,
and if he has not
through language training, attained a similar or higher level of language proficiency
." (Emphasis added)
[14]
The applicant had been offered the position, however having failed to meet the language requirements, he was denied the appointment. He had previously received language training, had achieved the required level but subsequently lost his competency. He sought an order declaring paragraph 4(2)(d) ultra vires as violating the merit principle. The Court of Appeal dismissed the application on the grounds that the order was validly made pursuant to s. 39 of the
(now s. 41). Hugessen, J., speaking for the majority of the court, determined that paragraph 4(2)(d) of the order excluded the applicant. He found that the language of the exclusion order intended that a person previously trained at public expense to meet a level of language proficiency and who subsequently fell below that level, should not be entitled to an exclusion from the language requirement of a position while they obtained further language training at public expense. As I read the court's reasoning, it was because of the precision in wording of the exclusion order that the court found that it fell within the parameters of the then s. 39, now s. 41 of the
Dozens of exclusion orders were filed in these proceedings and there is no doubt that in all cases they refer to specific positions or persons which permit the Commission to approve appointments excluding them from the operation of the
On reading the present order (PC 1990-513), it is clear that it would permit the Commission to transfer a public servant from one job to another in a different Department, without having been determined to be the "best qualified" for the job. No right of appeal would be available to any other employee nor to anyone believing that his or her opportunities for advancement had been prejudicially affected. An example given to me was that of a payroll clerk, a member of the CR group, employed with the National Energy Board could conveniently be transferred to the Department of Revenue.
[17]
On the facts and evidence adduced, I am satisfied that there may very well be employees who feel that their opportunities may have been prejudicially affected by such a transfer. It must be remembered that a transfer can constitute a positive career move notwithstanding the fact that there is no change in occupational group, level, term of employment or renumeration. The Crown's own witness admitted on cross-examination that a transfer could, in some instances, "increase the potential for promotion".
[18]
The present
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
as I read it, departs substantially from the merit principle. According to the order, the basis for selection is not whether or not a candidate is "the best qualified", but rather whether or not the candidate is "qualified". It removes the right for anyone in the Public Service to appeal the appointment.
[19]
I am sympathetic with the Commission's attempts to implement more flexibility in the system. Nevertheless, during the past ten years, the court has been consistent in upholding merit. It has always maintained that ss. 10 and 21 cannot easily be avoided, since these provisions were specifically legislated for the protection of Public Servants and for the promotion and maintenance of the merit principle.
[20]
The Commission has been provided with some discretion to exclude certain persons or positions from the strict requirements of adherence to the merit principle by virtue of ss. 37 and 41 of the
. It follows that any order made pursuant to s. 41 must be made in strict compliance with its provisions. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the order does not comply with s. 41 in that it does not specifically address certain "positions or persons" or "classes of positions or persons". It is undeniably directed at a type of appointment, namely "lateral transfers".
[21]
At the present time, when a vacancy occurs, the line manager decides how that position is to be filled, with or without competition. In those cases, every unsuccessful candidate or every person whose opportunities have been prejudicially affected, may appeal. As a result of this new
, if it is pressing to fill a vacancy, and hiring "the best" is not important, the line manager may decide to fill the position by way of a lateral transfer. All he must consider in filling the position is "Is he or she qualified and are they at the same level?". The only recourse for a public service who may feel that he or she is better qualified, or that their opportunity for advancement has been curtailed, is to file a grievance or request an investigation, which remedies were admitted to be generally ineffective.
[22]
Counsel pointed out that, because it is the line manager who generally decides how a vacancy within his Department is to be filled, it is possible that every opening in the federal Public Service could be staffed by means of lateral transfer. In theory, the
could apply to every public servant who belonged to the same occupational group or level regardless of the Department or Ministry.
[23]
It is my view that because of the potentially broad application of the order, it does not comply with s. 41 and I hereby declare that the
Transfer Exclusion Approval Order
and the
Transfer Regulations
(PC 1990-513, SOR 90-81) are ultra vires the Commission and the Governor-in-Council.
[24]
Having reached this conclusion, I find it unnecessary to consider counsel's submission that the effect of the order was to subdelegate the authority vested exclusively with the Commission to the line managers.
[25]
Having considered the jurisprudence which is consistent in maintaining the merit principle; having had an opportunity to peruse dozens of exclusion orders which are specific in nature; having considered the overall purpose of the enabling legislation and being satisfied that the Commission does in some instances require more flexibility, I am convinced that the problem lies not with the Commission or the court but with Parliament.
[26]
In so finding, I am reminded of words of Le Dain, J., in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.) (leave to appeal to S.C.C. denied), at 812:
"I am mindful that the conclusion reached in this case may severely limit the flexibility provided by the power of transfer in the Public Service, to the extent that a particular transfer constitutes an appointment within the meaning of the
but if more is required in this regard it should be clearly provided by the legislation
." (Emphasis added)
[27]
Costs to the plaintiff.
Order accordingly.
