This motion came before me on December 22, 1995 in Ottawa. The applicant seeks a ruling that the designated judge in the review of a certificate issued pursuant to s. 40.1 of the
Immigration Act
, (R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended) has jurisdiction to consider arguments and grant remedies pursuant to s. 24(1)
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and s. 52(1) of the
Constitution Act
, 1982. The respondent did not oppose this motion.
[2]
The applicant is the subject of a s. 40.1 certificate which has been referred, pursuant to s. 40.1(3)(a), to this court for determination as to whether it should be quashed. By an order dated October 23, 1995, Mr. Justice Teitelbaum, the designated judge, ordered that the court examine the security and intelligence reports and hear any other evidence in camera, in the absence of the applicant and his counsel. His Lordship determined that the evidence should not be disclosed on the grounds that such disclosure would be injurious to national security or safety of persons. On October 23, 1995, Mr. Justice Teitelbaum released a statement summarizing the information that, in his opinion, would enable the applicant to be reasonably informed of the circumstances giving rise to the issuance of the certificate.
[3]
On November 7, 1995, the respondent was served with a draft Notice of Motion by the applicant, challenging the constitutionality of clauses 19(1)(e)(iv)(C) and 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) of the
Immigration Act
and alleging that the extent of disclosure of information by the designated judge pursuant to s. 40.1 does not comply with the
Charter
. The applicant's motion was spurred by MacKay, J.'s decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)), wherein it was determined that s. 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
contravenes s. 2(d) of the
Charter
and is not a reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. At issue is whether Mr. Justice Teitelbaum, sitting as the designated judge, has jurisdiction to hear the applicant's
Charter
arguments and, if required, issue a
Charter
Earlier decisions of this court determined that a designated judge was without jurisdiction to hear
Charter
issues. In the case of
Re Shandi
((1992), 51 F.T.R. 252; 17 Imm L.R.(2d) 54 (T.D.)) I, stated:
"I ruled that the constitutionality of sections of the
Immigration Act
could not be challenged at the hearing but that I would accept arguments based on the possibility that the
Charter
rights of the applicant had not been met. This latter pronouncement by me was in error and conformed with the dissenting judgment of Lamer, J., of the Supreme Court of Canada in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Denault, J., found that the role of the court was to enforce the applicable legislation and, in the context of a s. 40.1 hearing, it was not the role of the court to "determine whether the section in question is contrary to the rights and liberties guaranteed by the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
". However, in both of these cases, the respondent Ministers argued that the court was without jurisdiction and the issue was not otherwise fully explored. While I do not agree with the applicant that these cases were wrongly decided, I was willing to consider the applicant's arguments.

, ([1986] 1 S.C.R. 863; 67 N.R. 241; 16 O.A.C. 81; 52 C.R.(3d) 1; 29 D.L.R.(4th) 161; 26 C.C.C.(3d) 481), the Supreme Court of Canada found that a "court of competent jurisdiction" for the purpose of granting a
Charter
remedy under s. 24(1) is a court with jurisdiction over the parties, the subject matter, and the remedy sought. Section 52(1) of the
Constitution Act
, 1982 does not make reference to a "court of competent jurisdiction" or specify which bodies may consider and rule on constitutional questions. However, the Supreme Court of Canada in the cases of
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 271; 4 C.R.R.(2d) 1); and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 358), indicated that jurisdiction must have expressly or impliedly been conferred on the tribunal by the empowering statute.
Douglas College

specifically considered whether administrative tribunals had the power to grant constitutional remedies. Given that a Federal Court judge is appointed to a superior court, I do not think that these decisions enlighten the case at bar. Rather, I think it is reasonable to consider constitutional issues raised under s. 52(1) similarly to issues raised under s. 24(1). Provided that the designated judge has jurisdiction over the whole of the matter before him or her -- the parties, the subject matter, and the remedy sought -- he or she has jurisdiction to consider constitutional issues and grant constitutional remedies.
[6]
The parties in a s. 40.1 hearing are the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, the Solicitor General of Canada, and the person about whom the certificate is issued. I accept that the judge considering the certificate has jurisdiction over the parties since s. 40.1(4) provides for their appearance before him or her. Likewise, I do not think it can be disputed that the designated Federal Court judge has jurisdiction over the subject matter: the certificate and its evidentiary basis. Pursuant to s. 40.1(4), the designated judge examines the security or intelligence reports considered by the Minister and the Solicitor General, provides a summary of the evidence to the person named in the certificate, and gives him or her a reasonable opportunity to be heard.
[7]
In my view, the real issue is whether the designated judge in a s. 40.1 hearing has jurisdiction to grant the remedy sought. Section 40.1(4)(d) states that the designated judge shall "determine whether the certificate filed by the Minister and the Solicitor General is reasonable on the basis of the evidence and the information available to the Chief Justice or the designated judge, as the case may be, and, if found not to be reasonable, quash the certificate." In
Re Baroud
, Denault, J., found that the role of this court is neither to substitute its decision for that of the Minister and the Solicitor General, nor to find that they were correct in their assessment of the evidence. Rather, the designated judge must determine, based on the evidence presented to him or her, whether the Ministers' decision to issue the certificate is reasonable.
[8]
Does the assessment of reasonableness, pursuant to s. 40.1(4)(d), include an assessment of whether upholding the certificate would breach the applicant's constitutional rights? I do not find that it does. In my view, reasonableness and constitutionality are distinct issues. Reasonableness involves an evaluation of the evidence to determine if it supports the Ministers' decision; constitutionality is a more in-depth assessment of the applicant's constitutional rights. In my view, a plain reading of s. 40.1(4)(d) gives the designated judge jurisdiction only to consider the reasonableness of the certificate. If Parliament had intended the designated judge to consider the validity of the certificate, including its constitutionality, the section could have been so drafted.
[9]
My decision that the designated judge does not have jurisdiction to consider
Charter
matters is further supported by the fact that there is no appeal from the decision of the designated judge. Section 40.1(6) states:
"A determination under paragraph (4)(d) is not subject to appeal or review by any court."
By expressly prohibiting further appeal or review, Parliament reinforced the notion that proceedings under s. 40.1 of the
Immigration Act
are intended only to consider whether the Ministers' decision to issue the certificate is reasonable on the basis of the available evidence.
[10]
The applicant submits, however, that s. 40.1(6) only prevents appeal or review of the merits of the designated judge's determination of the reasonableness of the certificate, but it does not prevent appeals on constitutional issues. In support of his submission, the applicant relies on three cases:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 50; 97 W.A.C. 50 (S.C.C.)). In each of these cases, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the availability of appeal on a constitutional question when the relevant legislation appeared to limit the right of appeal.
[11]
Section 674 of the
precludes appeals in respect of indictable offences, except in circumstances authorized in the
. This limitation on appeal is also mirrored in s. 40(3) of the
which precludes appeal "from a judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence." On plain reading, these sections would appear to preclude an appeal on a constitutional issue except in the prescribed circumstances. However, the Supreme Court of Canada found a right of appeal via s. 40(1) of the
. The court concluded that s. 40(1) of the
provided jurisdiction to hear an appeal on a constitutional question when such a question constitutes a final judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal or of the highest court of final resort in a province. Section 40(1) of the
states:
"40(1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court from any final or other judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal or of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court, where, with respect to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme Court is of the opinion that any question involved therein is, by reason of its public importance or the importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed law and fact involved in that question, one that ought to be decided by the Supreme Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or significance as to warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from that judgment is accordingly granted by the Supreme Court."
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Lamer, C.J.S.C., found that to limit appeals on a strict reading of s. 40(3) of the
would result in an absurd situation. The constitutionality of a provision would be left in abeyance until some time in the future when another case on point happened to come along and resulted in a verdict that would provide an avenue of appeal through the
It is the applicant's submission that the situation in the case at bar is parallel to the situations in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> (supra). There is a limitation on the right of appeal in s. 40.1(6) of the
Immigration Act
; this limitation is akin to the limitation found in s. 674 of the
or s. 40(3) of the
. However, this limitation should be understood only to apply to adjudications on the reasonableness (merits) of the certificate, and not to any constitutional issues which may arise. In the applicant's submission, constitutional issues are separate from the determination of the reasonableness of the certificate pursuant to s. 40.1(4)(d). Moreover, there is a general appeal provision for all judgments and orders, whether final or interlocutory, of the Trial Division in s. 27(1) of the
Federal Court Act
. This broad appeal is similar to the broad appeal provision in s. 40(1) of the
. Section 27(1) of the
Federal Court Act
should be interpreted to provide appeal jurisdiction for constitutional questions, regardless of the plain wording of s. 40.1(6) of the
Immigration Act
.
[13]
While accepting the principles set out in the above-noted cases, the applicant's argument is based on the assumption that the designated judge is a "court of competent jurisdiction" to hear
Charter
arguments. If the designated judge has no jurisdiction to hear
Charter
arguments, then the lack of an appeal is irrelevant. In my view, the lack of appeal is
on an assumption that the designated judge does not have such jurisdiction. It is a further indication that Parliament intended that the designated judge only consider whether the certificate is reasonable on the basis of the available evidence. Questions of
Charter
infringement demand a much higher standard of proof and are incompatible with merely an assessment of reasonableness.
[14]
In summary, the clear language of s. 40.1 of the
Immigration Act
is incompatible with extensive
Charter
review and it is my conclusion that the designated judge in the review of a certificate does not have jurisdiction to consider arguments and grant remedies pursuant to s. 24(1)
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and s. 52(1) of the
Constitution Act
, 1982. Accordingly, this application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
