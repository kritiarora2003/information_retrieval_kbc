: This is an appeal by the applicant from an Order of Associate Senior Prothonotary Giles, dated April 17 and filed on April 19, 1996. The appeal relates to the determination by the prothonotary to refuse to order the respondent Minister to deliver to the applicant and file with the court a copy of a letter dated August 22, 1995 from Lt. Col. P.J. McCaffrey and to require answers to questions relating to that letter, and in effect recognizing the respondent's claim that the letter is subject to solicitor/client privilege.
[2]
The applicant's Notice of Motion, filed April 24, 1996 came on for hearing on Monday, April 29, 1996 in Toronto. After hearing counsel, I dismissed the application for reasons orally delivered from the bench which are now committed to writing for filing in accord with s. 51 of the
Federal Court Act
At the commencement of the hearing counsel for the respondent made a preliminary objection, urging that the court should not hear the application. It was suggested that the application was filed on short notice and if it were granted that would be prejudicial to the respondent.
[4]
The respondent urged that since counsel had not been served with the applicant's motion until after 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 24, that is after the close of normal business hours for the respondent's counsel's office, two clear days' notice was not provided as required in accord with rule 320. I concluded that the rule was not technically violated. Though service was not effected in normal business hours, the motion was served on the 24th of April and was filed in the court on that day advising that it was set down to be heard at a regular motions day on Monday, April 29, 1996. In my opinion, service was not technically outside the scope of the rule. Moreover, the rule permits the court to order that a motion be heard on short notice and in my view, the circumstances here warranted an abridgement of time, if that were required.
[5]
As to the matter of alleged prejudice to the respondent, in the event the applicant's motion should be allowed, the argument was essentially that since the application for judicial review, raising the basic issue between the parties, had been set down on an expedited schedule, to be heard on May 2 and 3, 1996 when it was set down to proceed peremptorily, the respondent would be placed in a position where there was no opportunity to respond or explain if it were now ordered that the letter in question can be produced, a day or so before the application for judicial review was to be heard. In my opinion, the court could adequately protect against prejudice to the interests of the respondent, if it should order that the letter in question be produced.
[6]
For these reasons the preliminary motion of the respondent to dismiss the application by the applicant, was dismissed.
[7]
The background to the main motion before me may be briefly explained as follows. The application for judicial review concerns a decision on behalf of the respondent Minister refusing to evaluate the applicant's bid submitted in response to a request for proposals concerning a particular contract for inservice support of maritime coastal defence vessels. That application was set down with a schedule for an expedited hearing. There were several interlocutory applications to the court with regard to the production of documents. In an affidavit and appended exhibit filed on behalf of Jean-Michel Demarcq for the respondent, and in cross-examination of Mr. Demarcq in relation to his affidavit, reference was made to the letter here in question, written by Lt. Colonel McCaffrey, an officer in the Office of the Judge Advocate General, providing advice to the Department of National Defence. That letter was apparently forwarded to members of the respondent's Department in connection with interdepartmental discussions concerning the consideration relating to tender bids submitted in response to the request for proposals which had elicited the applicant's bid.
[8]
The respondent claimed that the letter was privileged on the basis that it was legal advice provided by officers of the Crown responsible for advising the Department of National Defence and that its release by that Department to another department for intergovernmental purposes did not constitute waiver of the privilege. For the applicant it was claimed that no privilege attached to the letter but even if the letter were originally privileged, that privilege had been waived by provision of the letter to the respondent's Department and by the nature of references to that letter in the affidavit and cross-examination of Mr. Demarcq.
[9]
The applicant's concern was that, from the evidence adduced, it appeared the applicant's bid had been evaluated as having the highest score among some four bidders but its submission had finally not been accepted as a result of a decision that its bid failed to meet certain requirements of the request for proposals. That decision was said to be evidence of a lack of fairness in consideration of the applicant's proposal. The applicant believes that its position would be strengthened if the letter in issue were ordered produced since it is believed to set out the position of the Department of National Defence, whose interests were ultimately to be served under the contract for services for which the respondent's department had requested proposals.
[10]
After hearing counsel for the parties on April 16, 1996 the Prothonotary's Order provided, in part:
"Having concluded that the Departments of National Defence ('DND') and Public Works and Government Services ('DPW') have a common interest, namely the proper awarding of the contract, and that therefore, solicitor and client privilege existing in the legal opinion furnished to DND is not waived by supplying that legal opinion to DPW even though DPW may have chosen to disregard that opinion.
. . . . .
"It is ordered ... the correspondence with Colonel McCafrey [sic], that is documents A4 and A5, are privileged and do not have to be produced."
[11]
After hearing counsel, I dismissed the application appealing the decision of Prothonotary Giles. My Reasons for so doing are briefly these. On the basis of the comments of my colleague, Madame Justice Reed, in
Canada (Minister of Industry, Trade and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 168; 37 C.P.R.(3d) 1 at p. 6, it is clear that advice from counsel in the Department of Justice to other departments of Government may well be subject to solicitor-client privilege. In this case, Lt. Colonel McCaffrey as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Branch acts as counsel to the Department of National Defence. Though it may be perceived that he is acting as inhouse counsel, advice he may give of a legal nature intended to be confidential is subject to solicitor-client privilege just as if he were counsel in the Department of Justice or outside counsel.
[12]
Here, the letter in question falls within that aspect of privilege that concerns ongoing legal advice between a solicitor and his or her client. Having examined the letter I have no difficulty concluding that by its nature it was intended to be confidential and it concerns legal responsibilities arising in the course of considering bids submitted in relation to an invitation which ultimately may result in a contract. I am satisfied the document was subject to solicitor-client privilege.
[13]
Further, I am not persuaded that reference to the document and the fact of its existence in the affidavit of Mr. Demarcq and in an exhibit thereto constitutes waiver of privilege. In my opinion, answers by Mr. Demarcq in cross-examination on his affidavit concerning his understanding of the position of the Department of National Defence and that that position was based on the letter in question from Lt. Colonel McCaffrey does not constitute waiver of the privilege either. Mr. Demarcq may be wrong in his understanding of the position of the Department of National Defence and of his understanding that was based on the letter from Lt. Colonel McCaffrey. His evidence has been given on cross-examination and will be given whatever weight the hearing judge may consider appropriate, but it does not constitute waiver of the privilege claimed by the respondent Minister to whose officers the letter was provided for purposes of interdepartmental discussions in consideration of the circumstances arising from the bid for the contract by the applicant and by others. As Reed, J., noted in
the Executive Branch of the Government of Canada is the client, indivisible, and legal advice provided to one branch of the executive subject to solicitor-client privilege continues to be subject to that privilege, though the document containing the advice be made available to another branch of the executive.
[14]
The significance of solicitor-client privilege in advice provided by legal officers to the Crown and the general scope of the claim for privilege is described in the decision of MacGuigan and Décary, JJ.A., in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). Finally, if I had any doubt about whether privilege attached to the letter in question I note that in
Descôteaux et  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 605; 44 N.R. 462 at 520. Mr. Justice Lamer, as he then was, set out for the Supreme Court what is now a substantive rule of law concerning solicitor-client privilege. Included in his description is the following:
"2. Unless the law provides otherwise, when and to the extent that the legitimate exercise of a right would interfere with another person's right to have his communications with his lawyer kept confidential, the resulting conflict should be resolved in favour of protecting the confidentiality."
In view of this, any doubt I have concerning the confidentiality of the communication here in issue and its protection by solicitor-client privilege, would be resolved in favour of protecting the latter as privileged.
[15]
I note that at the conclusion of the hearing counsel for the respondent Minister raised the matter of costs urging that in this case, because of short notice, the fact that this hearing was brought only three days before argument on the application for judicial review, an order for costs was warranted, in favour of the respondent in relation to the motion. I was not persuaded. In my view, there was an arguable issue. In the normal course costs are not awarded in relation to judicial review proceedings and in my view the circumstances here are not so exceptional as to warrant an order for costs.
Application dismissed.
