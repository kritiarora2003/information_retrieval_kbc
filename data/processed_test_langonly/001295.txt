Reed, J.
[orally paragraphs 1 to 12]: With respect to the authority of the court on Judicial Review, I agree that it is not the same as on an Appeal. At the same time, even though one might find errors in a Board's Decision, one does not send the decision back for rehearing when one is convinced that no real purpose will be served by doing so. One does not quash a decision and send it back just for the sake of having a new hearing. When it is clear from the evidence on the record and from the decision that has been made that no different result could be reached on a rehearing, the appropriate course of action is to refuse an order requiring that such be done.
[2]
I am not convinced, in this case, that there were significant or substantial errors of fact or law made by the Board when it found that the conduct to which the applicant was subject was not persecution. The Board's decision that that conduct could not be classified as persecution so as to bring the applicant within the definition of a Convention Refugee was correct.
[3]
As Mr. Pike argued - well, as both Counsel argued - it is clear that there was discrimination. And I think even some of the documentary evidence indicates that there is discrimination in Israel with respect to new immigrants, particularly, the new immigrants from Russia.
[4]
As Mr. Pike also argued, there is discrimination in a lot of places, not excluding our own country. That does not mean however that there is state acquiescence or state acceptance of that situation. Nor does it mean that the "discrimination" amounts to persecution. In this particular instance, it is clear from the documentary evidence that the State of Israel provided new immigrants with services such as living accommodation, funds and programs to learn Hebrew, in order to try to assist the new immigrant to integrate into Israeli society.
[5]
It would be very, very difficult - in fact, I think it is impossible, on the basis of the evidence in this case, to classify the discrimination that existed or exits, as a result of being a new immigrant from Russia in Israel, as the kind of activity which gives rise to Convention Refugee status.
[6]
With respect to the obligations to serve in the military, I start from the position that it is not persecution to have compulsory military service. Clearly, that alone cannot be a ground for Convention Refugee status.
[7]
The Board referred to the position of a conscientious objector and said that it could not accept that this applicant objected to serving in the military on the grounds of being a conscientious objector because he had served in the army in Russia. This decision is soundly based insofar as the Board was considering whether he was a conscientious objector in the usual sense of that phrase, for example because he was a pacifist or was against war and all militarism on the grounds of principle, either religious or philosophical. The Board's decision in this regard is quite a credible conclusion.
[8]
What is more, there is no evidence that the applicant claimed exemption from military service in Israel on the ground that he was a conscientious objector and was refused exemption from military service. One would not be surprised to find that there are in Israel alternative methods of service for individuals falling into that category. But that aside, we simply do not know and as I have said there is no evidence that he objected to serving in the military as a conscientious objector when he was in Israel, so what disposition might be made by the Israeli government in such a case is not known.
[9]
What the applicant asserts is that he objects to serving in the military because of Israeli military activity against the Palestinians which he asserts contravenes acceptable international standards. I do not think the evidence supports a conclusion that the activity of the Israeli military falls into that category.
[10]
It is true that the evidence contains accounts of violations from time to time, or allegations, at least, of violations from time to time. And one would not be too surprised if the allegations were substantiated. But an isolated incident or incidents of the violation of international standards is not the kind of activity which the Federal Court of Appeal was referring to in the jurisprudence which has been cited. (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 1) One is talking about military activity which is condoned in a general way by the state, by the military forces. One thinks of places like El Salvador.
[11]
I do not see how any properly instructed Board could conclude, on the evidence in this case, that the obligation to serve in the Israeli military constituted persecution so as to make the applicant a Convention Refugee.
[12]
For those reasons, the application is dismissed. Thank you.
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  following portion of this judgment contains the written reasons filed on April 11, 1994, by Reed, J., in furtherance to her oral decision released on March 22, 1994.
[13]
Reed, J.
: The applicant emigrated to Israel from Russia under the Law of Return. He was entitled to do so because one of his grandparents was Jewish. He suffered discrimination in Israel because he was a new immigrant from Russia and because, while he was Jewish as a matter of racial ancestry, he is a member of the Russian Orthodox Christian church.
[14]
He applied for refugee status in Canada on the ground that he was subject to persecution in Israel because of his religion. The C.R.D.D. did not accept that claim. The C.R.D.D. decision was rendered before the Supreme Court decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  and before the Federal Court of Appeal decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 1. Counsel for the applicant argued that the Board, therefore, did not properly apply the law because its decision was made without reference to the principles set out in those two decisions. It was also argued that the Board made errors of fact.
[15]
I dismissed the application giving reasons orally from the bench. A copy of those reasons is attached [See paragraphs 1 to 12 in this decision]. In summary, I refused to return the case to the Board because I was convinced that to do so would be a waste of time. In my view, no properly instructed Board, even if it had reviewed the evidence in the light of
and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> could have found the applicant to be a Convention Refugee.
[16]
After that decision was rendered and I had left the court, counsel for the applicant asked if I would return to consider the certification of a question. I did so. Counsel for the respondent argued that the applicant had no right to apply for the certification of a question after the the decision was rendered. It was argued that it was counsel's responsibility to raise the issue of possible certification at the end of his or her argument and before a decision was rendered. In this case the question related not to the Board's decision as such, or solely to the applicable rules of law relating to convention refugee determination cases, but to whether I had authority on judicial review to render the decision given. The question proposed was:
"Where a tribunal fails to consider the law as stated by the Courts (as in this case where the tribunal failed to consider, on the evidence before it, whether or not the military activity of a country's army violates international standards in accordance with Court's decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  dispose of that very legal question not properly determined by the tribunal?"
[17]
Two questions arise: (1) whether I am entitled to certify a question in the circumstances in question; (2) whether this particular question should be certified. Section 83(1) of the
Immigration Act
, states:
"83(1) A judgment of the Federal Court - Trial Division on an application for judicial review with respect to any decision or order made, or any matters arising, under this Act or the rules or regulations thereunder may be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal
only if
the Federal Court - Trial Division
has at the time of rendering judgment certified
that a serious question of general importance is involved and has stated that question." (underlining added)
[18]
Rule 337 of the
Federal Court Rules
"337(1) The Court may dispose of any matter that has been the subject matter of a hearing
(a) by delivering judgment from the bench before the hearing of the case has been concluded, or
(b) after having reserved judgment at the conclusion of the hearing, by depositing the necessary document in the Registry,
in the manner provided by paragraph (2).
"(2) When the Court has reached a conclusion as to the judgment to be pronounced, it shall, in addition to giving reasons for judgment, if any,
(a) by a separate document signed by the presiding judge, pronounce the judgment (Form 14); or
(b) at the end of the reasons therefor, if any, and otherwise by a special declaration of its conclusion, which may be given orally from the bench or by a document deposited in the Registry, indicate that one of the parties (usually the successful party) may prepare a draft of an appropriate judgment to implement the Court's conclusion and move for judgment accordingly (which motion will usually be made under Rule 324).
"(3) Upon the return of a motion under paragraph (2)(b), the Court will settle the terms and pronounce the judgment, which will be signed by the presiding judge (Form 14).
"(4) A judgment pronounced under paragraph (2)(a) or paragraph (3) will, subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), be in final form.
. . . . ."
[19]
It is clear that the oral rendering of an order is the order of the court,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). At the same time, insofar as s. 83(1) of the
Immigration Act
is concerned I do not think that the phrase "at the time of rendering judgment" should be interpreted as having occurred until after the judgment has been pronounced (or recorded) in written form pursuant to rule 337(2). That is particularly so in a case such as the present where the reason for which certification is sought could not reasonably have been foreseen by counsel until after the court's decision was rendered. For the reasons given I am of the view that I have jurisdiction to certify a question in this case.
[20]
I turn to the merits.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) an adjudicator failed to comply with two
Immigration Act Regulations
in a deportation inquiry. Section 32(1) required the adjudicator to afford the claimant or his counsel "a reasonable opportunity to present such evidence as he deems proper and the adjudicator allows". Section 34(2) required the adjudicator to invite submissions by counsel prior to making and announcing his decision. Hugessen, J.A., (for the majority) found that the adjudicator had breached these sections, and had erred in law. He declined to quash the decision, stating at 341:
"It is, in my opinion, clear beyond dispute, however, that these errors could not and did not have any effect upon the outcome of the inquiry. In the light of the admission made by his counsel and confirmed by Mr. Schaaf himself, there is simply no evidence and no submission which human ingenuity could conceive that would cause the adjudicator to render a decision different from the one he, in fact, rendered."
[21]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at p. 312, MacGuigan, J.A., cited <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and held that:
"... an inconsequential error, or even a number of them, which could have no effect on the outcome, do not require this court to set aside a decision under s. 28(1)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
... In my mind, the Board made no error of law by
infringing the principle of audi alteram partem
in this case ... I think any error attributable to the Board would be inconsequential, a mere technical breach, and should not be a basis for judicial reversal. The authorities have all required a real possibility that the result was affected." (Emphasis added)
[22]
The Federal Court of Appeal has applied <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> not only in cases of procedural irregularity but also to cases involving an error of law on a substantive point. For example, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), MacGuigan, J.A., held at pp. 323-324, that:
"From this passage it is unclear what the legal test was applied by the Refugee Division in determining that the appellant was an accomplice ... [T]he reference is so general and the standard applied so elusive that I believe it must be said that the Refugee Division has erred in law, and its decision must be set aside and the matter remitted for redetermination
on the basis of the correct approach, no properly instructed tribunal could have come to a different conclusion ...". (footnote omitted)
[23]
While the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision was an "appeal" on judicial review grounds (see
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, s. 82.3 as enacted by R.S.C. 1985 (4th Supp.), c. 28, s. 19), both the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and the
Canadian Cable Television Association
decisions were judicial review proceedings and not "appeals". A discussion of the intertwined nature of "appeals" and "judicial review" in federal legislation is found in a recent paper by Madame Justice Desjardins:
Review of Administrative Action in the Federal Court of Canada: The New Style in a Pluralistic Setting
, Law Society of Upper Canada Special Lectures, 1992, 404 at pp. 411-412. A discussion of the discretionary nature of the prerogative writs is found in many texts on administrative law. I will cite only one: B.L. Jones,
Garner's Administrative Law
(1989, 7th Ed.), at p. 220.
[24]
In the light of the jurisprudence cited above, I do not think that the question which has been posed raises a serious issue of general importance. Thus it would be inappropriate to certify the question.
Application dismissed.
