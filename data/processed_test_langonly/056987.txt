[TRANSLATION]: The applicant is asking the court to issue a writ of certiorari to set aside the decision of the Deputy Commissioner, Correctional Service Canada, to transfer him to a high maximum security unit (HMSU).
[2]
In support of his application counsel for the applicant alleged that information given to his client by the prison authorities was insufficient for him to be able to answer the notice recommending the transfer. He contended that the applicant had not had a full and complete defence. This notice from the prison authorities gave the inmate the following reasons for his transfer:
"Information of a confidential nature from various information sources has identified you as taking an active part in the preparation of an armed escape with two fellow inmates.
"Further, your cell was found to contain a .12 rifle cartridge, saw blades concealed in a mirror and a ventilator motor. A search of your person disclosed pieces that could be used to connect drill bits to the motor."
[3]
The applicant did not deny that unauthorized items were found in his cell and he provided explanations which manifestly were not accepted. He especially objected to the charge of "taking an active part in the preparation of an armed escape together with two fellow inmates", which he categorically denied. His charge that the prison authorities failed to provide information resulted from this reason for the notice for transfer. His counsel, fully aware of the case law on the point, did not insist on knowing the names of the informers, but he wanted to know, inter alia, with which fellow inmates his client was supposed to have prepared an armed escape and how he "took an active part". He further objected to the fact that the authorities did not simply lay a charge under the Disciplinary Code of having contraband in his possession, which would have given him an opportunity to offer explanations and would have been less serious for him than a notice of transfer to a high maximum security penitentiary. He also cited the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in Demaria, [1987] 1 F.C. 74; 69 N.R. 135, and of the Trial Division in Jamieson, T-75-86 [2 F.T.R. 146].

The applicant is an inmate at the Laval Institution and is serving a term of life imprisonment for two murders committed in 1984. The affidavit reply of Pierre Groulx, deputy director, correctional operations, at the Laval Institution indicated that the applicant had spent time in other institutions prior to these convictions, and that several times in the past he had tried to escape, inter alia, from the Cowansville Penitentiary.
[5]
In September and October 1987 the prison authorities learned that there was an escape conspiracy involving the applicant and other inmates, and items that could be used in such an escape were actually found. According to the confidential information given to Pierre Groulx on the morning of October 22, 1987 items that could be used in an escape attempt, including a .12 calibre rifle bullet, a second ventilator motor, saw blades, a partly completed homemade rifle, other electrical wires and drill bits could also be found in various places. A search of the applicant's cell in fact disclosed a .12 calibre rifle bullet, saw blades concealed in a mirror and an electric motor. These compromising items confirmed the authorities' fears of an armed escape. On the same day the alleged authors of the escape conspiracy, including the applicant, all denied their participation when interviewed singly by Deputy Director Groulx, but at a second interview requested by the applicant he allegedly said that his only involvement in the escape conspiracy was to make a .12 calibre rifle, for he said he was the only one who had the knowledge required to do this. On October 23, 1987 the applicant was placed in administrative segregation at the Donnacona Institution along with other inmates suspected in the escape conspiracy, while the investigation into the conspiracy was under way. Another search of the applicant's cell disclosed a toothbrush equipped with a razor blade soldered to one end of the brush and a brown extension cord, which were placed with the items previously found in the applicant's cell.
[6]
As a consequence of this investigation it was recommended that the applicant be transferred to a high maximum security unit, category S-7. Accordingly, on November 6, 1987 the applicant received his notice of a transfer to this unit: he had forty-eight hours in which to submit any comments on this recommendation. Instead of making comments in writing, the applicant telephoned Deputy Director Groulx in an attempt to avoid the transfer, but without success. On November 25, 1987 the prison authorities told him that as he had failed to answer the notice recommending transfer they intended to implement the recommendation, and at this time he was given the progress summary. On December 10, 1987, when all the deadlines for doing so had long since expired, the applicant submitted his comments, arguments and submissions through his counsel to the high maximum security case committee. The prison authorities acknowledged receipt of these submissions (Dec. 17, 1987) and agreed to reopen the investigation. On January 21, 1988 the committee ruled on the applicant's case after considering his counsel's representations, inter alia, and recommended to the Deputy Commissioner of the Correctional Service that the applicant be placed in an S-7 unit. Deputy Commissioner Perron approved this recommendation on February 9, 1988. On February 25 following, the applicant submitted his application for certiorari under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act.

In the case at bar the court is required not to act in place of the prison authorities but to determine whether they acted fairly toward the inmate in making their decision. He must persuade the court.
[8]
I was definitely not persuaded by the inmate that the prison authorities did not carry out their duty to act fairly in making the decision to transfer him to another high maximum security institution. The applicant fully realized the nature of the charge against him and apparently sought to minimize his involvement in the escape conspiracy, by trying to maintain that his participation consisted only of making a .12 calibre rifle and by providing information on the hiding place of a .12 calibre bullet, when it had already been found (para. 23 of the Groulx affidavit). Further, he had an opportunity to defend himself even though the forty-eight-hour notice had long expired, and the record indicates that his submissions were taken into consideration before the decision was made. He undoubtedly would have preferred that a charge simply be laid before the disciplinary tribunal, but this choice of means is for the prison authorities to make. His objection was thus more to the advisability than the legality of the decision.
[9]
The facts in the case at bar are strangely similar to those in Hnatiuk (T-486-87) [12 F.T.R. 44], where I had occasion to discuss the applicable case law, including Martineau, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602; 30 N.R. 119; 106 D.L.R.(3d) 385; 13 C.R.(3d) 1, a judgment of the Supreme Court, and Demaria, a judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal (supra), in which Hugessen, J., said the following:
"It is not disputed that a reasonably grounded belief that the appellant had brought cyanide into Collins Bay would be an adequate justification for the decision to retransfer him to Millhaven. It is also not in issue that in reaching that decision the authorities were under a duty to act fairly towards the appellant.
The only real question in the present case is as to the content of that duty. More narrowly still, it is to know when the appellant was given adequate notice of what was being alleged against him and a fair opportunity to answer those allegations
." (my emphasis)
It is hardly necessary to say that in Demaria, though the inmate was suspected of bringing in cyanide, he was also told that none had in fact been found. In the case at bar the confidential information about a possible escape, the discovery of various items including those found in the applicant's cell, the meetings between the applicant and Deputy Director Groulx and the statements made by the applicant in an effort to minimize his participation in the scheme were sufficient to connect him with the preparation of an armed escape, and are all facts which he was told of by the prison authorities. The decision to transfer him was made after the applicant had had plenty of opportunity to make submissions.

The application for certiorari is dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.
