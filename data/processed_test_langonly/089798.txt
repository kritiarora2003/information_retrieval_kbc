: The defendant is applying for an order striking out the statement of claim in this action on the grounds that it constitutes an abuse of process of the court or, alternatively, for an order staying the action until such time as the Registrar of Trademarks has rendered a decision on its pending trademarks application before him.
[2]
In the present action, the plaintiff as the alleged previous owner and user of the official marks Olympic and Canadian Olympic Association, as to which public notice has apparently been given by the Registrar pursuant to section 9(1)(m)(iii) of the Trademarks Act, is suing the defendant for, among other things, the following relief:
1. A declaration that the adoption by the defendant of the names Olympic Life Publishing Limited and Olympic Life in connection with its business is prohibited by sections 9 and 11 of the Trademarks Act.
2. Damages and an accounting.
3. An injunction prohibiting the use of the mark.
4. An order obliging the defendant to change its corporate name.
5. The usual order for delivery up of labels, signs, letterheads and other such documents and materials which might offend against the terms of the injunction.
[3]
Subsequent to the date when the plaintiff had allegedly become the owner and user of the official marks Olympic and Canadian Olympic Association, the defendant applied for the trademark Olympic Life, which it apparently used in connection with its publishing business and which it intended to use in conjunction with the sale of sportswear, clothing and general merchandise. The defendant's application was dated March 26, 1982 and was advertised by the Registrar on February 1, 1984. The plaintiff filed a statement of opposition on February 23, 1984 and a counter statement was filed by the defendant on May 3, 1984. Evidence on the registration issue has been submitted to the Registrar by both parties, but he has not rendered his decision as to whether he should allow or reject the defendant's application.
[4]
The statement of claim in the present action was issued on May 25, 1984. A defence was served and filed as well as a reply and joinder of issue.
[5]
The defendant, having already pleaded to the statement of claim, is much too late in requesting that it be struck out as an abuse of process. It has at times been said that a defendant, in such a case, is estopped from attacking the statement of claim on such a ground. Unless very exceptional circumstances exist or the objection is part of the defence, a motion to strike out on these grounds must be made before pleading to the claim. It would be quite different if the motion were based on a lack of jurisdiction or on the ground that the claim discloses no triable cause of action. In any event, the only ground advanced in the argument for abuse of process is that the Registrar's decision on the above mentioned application for registration of the trademark is presently pending.
[6]
The Registrar obviously only has jurisdiction to decide the issue of whether or notHe has no jurisdiction or authority to grant any of the relief requested in the present action.
[7]
Neither the mere fact that the result of the Registrar's decision, should it come before the trial of the present action, might have a bearing on the ultimate decision at trial, nor the objection that the final decisions might in some way prove to be contradictory, constitute valid grounds for considering the present action as an abuse of process. Should the allegations in the claim be proven, the plaintiff would undoubtedly be entitled to the relief claimed.
[8]
Aside from the procedural objection, there is therefore no reason on the merits to strike out the statement of claim.
[9]
The same considerations apply almost in their entirety to the application for a stay of this action.
[10]
Although there may be facts which are common to both proceedings, as well as certain findings involving similar mixed questions of law and fact, the subject matter of the litigation, the basic issues to be determined as well as the remedies sought are completely different. The Registrar is strictly limited to determining a question in rem, which, although the consequences flowing from it are binding on the public at large, pertains only to the single issue as to whether the trademark, as applied for, will or will not be registered. On the other hand, the plaintiff's action is strictly inter partes, the relief claimed covers legal issues and remedies over which the Registrar has no jurisdiction whatsoever and the subject matter is not the same, since the registration application pertains to the trademark Olympic Life while the present action relates to the official marks Olympic and the Canadian Olympic Association. There can therefore be no question of multiplicity of proceedings as argued by counsel for the defendant.
[11]
The right to have recourse to the courts is very fundamental to our democratic society and to the common law. Unless compelling reasons of public order, serious Â of justice or substantial prejudice to some other party can be shown to exist, a plaintiff should never be deprived of his right to prosecute his claim normally in accordance with the law and the rules of court. None of these conditions have been shown to exist.
[12]
The application will therefore be dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.
