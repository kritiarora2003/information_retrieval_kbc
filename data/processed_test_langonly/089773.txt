Giles, A.S.P.
: The motion before me sought an order that all future motions in this action be heard in Ottawa. An earlier motion seeking an order that the trial be held in Ottawa was dismissed as premature. The following additional facts were available to me. The plaintiff lives in Palgrave, a centre some 30 kilometres north of the main Toronto airport at Malton and perhaps a further 20 kilometres from the Court.
[2]
The plaintiff can fly to Ottawa without expense.
[3]
The plaintiff consults a legal firm in Ottawa about this action but the firm are not her solicitors of record. They might occasionally furnish counsel to argue a particular point in Court.
[4]
The plaintiff has been able to negotiate lower charges for fees with the Ottawa legal firm than she has with her legal connections in Toronto.
[5]
The plaintiff wishes to have further motions heard in Ottawa.
[6]
The plaintiff has commenced actions in Toronto against individuals, which actions involve the same facts or many of them. A substantial part of the plaintiffs' case against the Crown is based on the alleged vicarious liability of the Crown for the alleged wrongdoing of the individuals. Counsel for the Crown based in Toronto have been actually involved in some of the cases involving the individuals and in an earlier case of the same general nature as the present one.
[7]
Counsel for the Crown, who are involved in the Toronto cases, would have to be transported at expense to Ottawa if motions were to be held in Ottawa or alternatively new counsel based in Ottawa would have to be retained who would not have the advantage of direct involvement with the Toronto based actions.
[8]
In my view, the matter of the place for hearing a motion is to be determined by the balance of convenience as it may appear when each motion is to be set down. It is not appropriate to prescribe the place of hearing of motions immutably in advance and today's motion will be dismissed. It may however be helpful to forestall regular adverse awards of costs if I indicate factors which should be considered determining the balance of convenience.
[9]
In the ordinary way very little weight would be given to the preference of the Crown because the Crown presumably has skilled counsel available in Ottawa as well as Toronto. In this case, where there are other cases in Toronto involving similar facts, other considerations will enter the balance.
[10]
In addition one has to consider the convenience of the plaintiffs and the public interest in efficient administration of justice.
[11]
The convenience of the plaintiffs means just that and is to be determined objectively on the evidence. It does not mean the expressed preference of the plaintiffs. In determining the convenience of the plaintiffs I note that they are both represented by Mrs. David personally, the individual plaintiff. Mrs. David lives in Palgrave which is some miles north of the Toronto airport at Malton which is almost on the direct route from Palgrave to the Toronto courthouse and from which frequent flights are made every day to Ottawa. The plaintiff consults solicitors in Ottawa and wishes to continue to do so but those solicitors do not appear in court for the plaintiffs. Court sittings for motions in Ottawa and Toronto start at 10:00 a.m.
[12]
If a motion was to be heard in Ottawa, Mrs. David would have to go from Palgrave to Ottawa. If, as she indicates is preferable, she has to take legal advice before appearing on the motions, she would have to go to Ottawa and obtain legal advice and get to the Court before 10:00 a.m. It occurs to me that she would have to go to Ottawa and consult her lawyers on an earlier day and then either spend the night in Ottawa or return to Palgrave and come again to Ottawa on the day the motion is to be heard. I assume staying in Ottawa will be the least inconvenient but in the equation I am about to set up it should be remembered that an additional return trip between Ottawa and Palgrave may be substituted for "overnight in Ottawa".
[13]
If the motion is to be heard in Toronto, Mrs. David will have to go from Palgrave to Ottawa, obtain legal advice, return to Palgrave, then go from Palgrave to Toronto, appear on the motion in Toronto and return to Palgrave. To determine the convenience of Mrs. David we have the following factors:
(1) If the motion is to be heard in Ottawa:
(a) journey Palgrave to Ottawa
(b) consult solicitors in Ottawa
(c) overnight in Ottawa
(d) appearance in Court in Ottawa
(e) journey Ottawa to Palgrave
(2) If the motion is to be heard in Toronto, we have the following:
(a) journey Palgrave to Ottawa
(b) consult solicitors in Ottawa
(c) journey Ottawa to Palgrave
(e) appearance in Court
(f) journey Toronto to Palgrave
[14]
If one cancels out the factors in common, the comparison is between a stay overnight in Ottawa and a return trip between Palgrave and Toronto, whichever is the most convenient. The difference is slight. We have to take into consideration the fact that the convenience of the Crown is to be ignored only because the Crown presumably could retain counsel based in Ottawa if the matters were always heard in Ottawa. Such counsel would not of course be the same counsel as in Toronto and therefore would not be the counsel whose knowledge of matters related to the case had been improved by knowledge of the cases current in the Ontario Courts and in the former action in this Court.
[15]
In my view the fact that the motion is addressed by Crown counsel who has considerable experience in litigation arising from these facts (as would be the case if Toronto were the location) is not merely of advantage to the Crown but also of potential advantage to the plaintiffs. I also consider that the deployment of counsel who have been educated by their experience in other actions on these facts would contribute to the efficiency, economy and speed with which this matter could be disposed of. It is not only a matter of financial advantage to the Crown (which in my view carries very little weight) but it is in the objective interests of justice that similar case-educated counsel should participate (with regard to the objective interests of justice being benefitted by retaining similar case-educated counsel, see
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; [1986] 3 All E.R. 843 (H.L.) at 485 A.C.).
[16]
Considering the balance of convenience as to the place of hearing the motion, I note that in favour of an Ottawa venue we have the possible advantage of spending the night in Ottawa over the return trip from Palgrave to Toronto. On the other side we have the advantage to the plaintiff and the best interests of justice and incidentally the benefit of counsel who have ongoing experience with the issues. It will be noted that in minimizing the weight to be given to any convenience of the Crown, I did so because of the reasoning of President Jackett in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  In this case the fact that there has been considerable other litigation handled by Toronto offices of the Crown would indicate that the interests of justice would be best served by making use of the experienced counsel in Toronto. While I did not find it necessary to do so, I believe it will be justifiable to include in the balance in favour of a Toronto venue for the motion, the fact that the cost and inconvenience of sending similar case-educated counsel to Ottawa would make the balance in favour of a Toronto venue overwhelming.
[17]
As I have indicated the motion before me should have been returnable in Toronto. Each other motion should be returnable in the place where the balance of convenience dictates at the time it is set down.
[18]
I note that counsel for the Crown conceded that if Ottawa based counsel were intending to appear for the plaintiff, the Crown would not object to having to fly counsel from Toronto and notice of such possible appearance should be given to the Crown counsel.
[19]
I have given these rather extensive reasons in the hopes that future misunderstandings will be avoided. It does occur to me that the necessity of trips to Ottawa, which is a special factor of this case, justifies increasing the notice necessary for regular interlocutory motions from two clear days, to say, four clear days. As I indicated from the Bench the Crown will be entitled to its costs of this motion in any event.
Order accordingly.
