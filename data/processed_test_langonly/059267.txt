Facts
[2]
In May, 1982, Bertram S. Miller Ltd. imported a shipment of trees into Canada from the United States. Acting under the authority of the
Plant Quarantine Act
, Agriculture Canada ordered the trees to be destroyed, because it suspected them to be contaminated with gypsy moth larvae. At the time, the applicant in this case was employed as an inspector with Agriculture Canada, and he was associated with the decision to destroy the shipment.
[3]
Subsequently, on December 23, 1982, Bertram S. Miller Ltd. sued the Crown in this court for damages relating to the destruction of the trees. The case,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)] Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied on December 18, 1986. The Crown was represented in these proceedings by solicitors from the Department of Justice, namely Allison Pringle, Sandra MacPherson and Derek Aylen.
[4]
On July 11, 1989, the applicant requested access to a letter purportedly written by Mr. Pringle to an official in Agriculture Canada in 1985, in relation to the
litigation. He also requested "any other written documentation" making reference to him. A large amount of material was released to the applicant, but certain materials were not released because it was alleged they were exempt from disclosure by virtue of solicitor-client privilege, pursuant to s. 27 of the
Privacy Act
.
[5]
After the partial refusal, the applicant filed a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner, in which he stated that he wanted access to the letter purportedly written by Mr. Pringle, on the ground that it contained certain "libelous" references to him concerning his credibility as a witness. The Privacy Commissioner conducted an investigation of the complaint pursuant to s. 29(1)(b) of the
. He found that the applicant's complaint was not justified, and that the materials in question were protected by solicitor-client privilege. The applicant has now brought this s. 41 application for review.
The materials sought by the applicant are annexed as exhibits to a second affidavit sworn by Mr. Pringle. This affidavit was filed on an ex parte basis, sealed and kept separate from other court files by order of Mr. Justice Strayer, dated November 30th, 1990. It seems clear from the affidavit of Mr. Pringle filed in response to the applicant's motion that the materials are protected from disclosure by solicitor-client privilege and s. 27 of the
The applicant brings this proceeding pursuant to s. 41 of the
, which reads as follows:
"41. Any individual who has been refused access to personal information requested under subsection 12(1) may, if a complaint has been made to the Privacy Commissioner in respect of the refusal, apply to the court for a review of the matter within forty-five days after the time the results of an investigation of the complaint by the Privacy Commissioner are reported to the complainant under subsection 35(2) or within such further time as the court may, either before or after the expiration of those forty-five days, fix or allow."
Certain personal information requested under s. 12(1) may be exempted from disclosure. Section 27 of the
permits the exemption of certain personal information from release if that information is subject to solicitor-client privilege.
"27. The head of a government institution may refuse to disclose personal information requested under subsection 12(1) that is subject to solicitor-client privilege."
As solicitor-client privilege is not defined in the
, it is necessary to refer to the common law for some background on the issue.
Solicitor-Client Privilege Generally
[8]
As Cross notes in his text
Cross on Evidence
(7th Ed. Butterworths), at p. 428, there are two distinct branches of solicitor-client privilege, the legal advice privilege and the litigation privilege. The legal advice privilege extends to all communications, written or oral, passing between solicitor and client for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. It is not necessary for the purposes of the legal advice privilege that the solicitor actually be retained: preliminary communications made by a potential client to a solicitor for the purposes of retaining the solicitor are also privileged:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 876-877. As for the litigation privilege, it protects from disclosure communications between a solicitor and client, or with third parties, which are made in the course of preparation for litigation, whether existing or contemplated, such as experts' reports.
[9]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on the scope of each branch, which he described as follows (at p. 33 Ex. C.R.):
"As it seems to me, there are really two quite different principles usually referred to as solicitor-client privilege, viz.:
(a) all communications, verbal or written, of a confidential character, between a client and a legal advisor directly related to the seeking, formulating or giving of legal advice or legal assistance (including the legal advisor's working papers, directly related thereto) are privileged; and
(b) all papers and materials created or obtained specially for the lawyer's 'brief' for litigation, whether existing or contemplated, are privileged."
[10]
Solicitor-client privilege is one of the fundamental tenets of our system of justice, and in my view its desirability and necessity are self-evident. Over a century ago the policy rationale for the legal advice branch of the privilege was stated by Brougham, L.C., in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 620:
"The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover. It is not (as has sometimes been said) on account of any particular importance which the law attributes to the business of legal professors, or any particular disposition to afford them protection (though certainly it may not be very easy to discover why a like privilege has been refused to others, and especially to medical advisors).
"But it is out of regard to the interests of justice, which cannot be upholden, and to the administration of justice, which cannot go on without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the courts, and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject of all judicial proceedings. If the privilege did not exist at all, every one would be thrown upon his own legal resources. Deprived of all professional assistance, a man would not venture to consult any skilful person, or would only dare to tell his counsellor half his case."
[11]
The reasons behind the litigation privilege were expressed by Jackett, P., in
, supra, as follows (at p. 33 Ex. C.R.)
"Turning to the 'lawyer's brief' rule, the reason for the rule is, obviously, that, under our adversary system of litigation, a lawyer's preparation of his client's case must not be inhibited by the possibility that the materials that he prepares can be taken out of his file and presented to the court other than that contemplated when they were prepared. What would aid in determining the truth when presented in the manner contemplated by the solicitor who directed its preparation might well be used to create a distortion of the truth to the prejudice of the client when presented by someone adverse in interest who did not understand what gave rise to its preparation. If lawyers were entitled to dip into each other's briefs by means of the discovery process, the straightforward preparation of cases for trial would develop into a most unsatisfactory travesty of our present system."
[12]
In Canada, the privilege has been elevated beyond a rule of evidence, and accorded the status of a substantive rule of law. The legal effect of the privilege has been expanded beyond protection of solicitor-client communications from disclosure in legal proceedings involving the parties to any circumstances where such communications may be disclosed without the client's consent.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  confidentiality of communications between solicitor and client may be raised in any circumstances where such communications are likely to be disclosed without the client's consent.
"2. Unless the law provides otherwise, when and to the extent that the legitimate exercise of a right would interfere with another person's right to have his communications with his lawyer kept confidential, the resulting conflict should be resolved in favour of protecting the confidentiality.
"3. When the law gives someone the authority to do something which, in the circumstances of the case, might interfere with that confidentiality, the decision to do so and the choice of means of exercising that authority should be determined with a view to not interfering with it except to the extent absolutely necessary in order to achieve the ends sought by the enabling legislation.
"4. Acts providing otherwise in situations under paragraph 2 and enabling legislation referred to in paragraph 3 must be interpreted restrictively."
[13]
As Lamer, J., observes implicitly in paragraph 1, the privilege is that of the client, not the solicitor, and is privileged for all time: Sopinka and Lederman,
The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases
, at pp. 177-181. The privilege may only be waived by the client: see
Cross on Evidence
There are exceptions to the privilege. One is informed waiver of the privilege by the client (see
, supra, at pp. 177-181), or implied waiver of a privileged document by its use in court (see
, supra, at pp. 438-439). Communications between a lawyer and client are not privileged when the client attempts to obtain legal advice that would facilitate a crime or fraud:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Also, the privilege extends only to communications, and does not protect from disclosure of certain facts discovered in the course of a solicitor-client relationship by either solicitor or client:
Application Of The Privilege
To The Case At Bar
[15]
In my opinion, there is clearly a solicitor-client privilege between the lawyers from the Department of Justice and the Government of Canada in the
case that shields the documents in question from disclosure by virtue of s. 27 of the
. The solicitor in this case is the Attorney General of Canada, and those who work under her auspices in the Department of Justice. The client is the executive branch of the Government of Canada, which includes the various ministries such as the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 236-238.
[16]
Even if a solicitor-client relationship is established, however, each document for which privilege is claimed must be demonstrated to meet the criteria discussed above, i.e. confidentiality, for the purpose of legal advice, or in contemplation of litigation:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 837. I have now taken the opportunity to carefully examine on a page-by-page basis the affidavit and exhibits filed in affidavit No. 2 by Allison Ross Pringle on December 7, 1990. This affidavit describes in some detail each document for which privilege is claimed. It has taken some time to examine approximately 350 pages which represent the copies of the exhibits to affidavit No. 2 of Mr. Pringle. In my view each is subject to solicitor-client privilege and therefore not required to be released under the
These documents are, as alleged from the submissions of the respondents, draft pleadings, notes of interviews with witnesses, correspondence with witnesses, and other material used in the conduct of the
litigation. This material clearly falls within the litigation privilege. Other documents include letters to the client represented by officials of the Department of Agriculture concerning advice from the solicitors and instructions from the client. These clearly fall within the legal advice privilege. No exceptions to the privilege are evident.
[18]
It should be pointed out that the applicant represented himself in this matter which always makes it difficult for opposing counsel and certainly for the court because it then becomes our obligation to see to it that the individual's rights are protected so far as is possible in the court. The applicant here raised the question or made the suggestion that he was a client and therefore entitled to all of the material with respect to the earlier lawsuit of
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  who answered questions on the examination for discovery for his employer the Department of Agriculture. Several other witnesses were interviewed including another employee of the Department who was in fact used as a witness at the trial. It is for counsel conducting the trial to determine what witnesses shall and shall not be called and in this case they came to the conclusion that they did not require the testimony of the applicant. The only defendant in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  unwilling to retain counsel and that in my view is a severe handicap to anyone appearing before the courts. In the course of his presentation I asked him how he even became aware of the fact that correspondence or notes might have referred to him in an uncomplimentary way or, as he said, made libelous statements. He indicated that some fellow employee of the federal government had given him this information but there was no affidavit evidence to this effect. Without counsel and without any affidavit evidence in support of his argument one is left to speculate only about the consequences of having the individual who informed him swear an affidavit to that effect.
[20]
This application is dismissed. In the circumstances there will be no order as to costs.
Application dismissed.
