: The plaintiff, an engineer who had been employed by the Department of Transport since 1963, submitted his resignation on April 28, 1978. He is now suing the defendant for damages, alleging that by various devices he was forced into resigning and that it was in reality a disguised dismissal. At the hearing the plaintiff reduced his claim to $55,644.84.
[2]
Before examining the evidence, it is important to indicate exactly the nature of the action brought by the plaintiff. After making his charges against management, alleging that he was the victim of harassment, interference, arrogance and pettiness (paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the statement of claim), the plaintiff briefly related in his statement (paragraphs 11 to 14) an incident in which he was asked to act contrary to his professional conscience, and finally alleged in paragraph 15 of his statement:
"That by the acts of its representatives, defendant was in substantial breach of its employment contract with the plaintiff, forcing plaintiff to resign under severe stress;"
[3]
The defence was that the plaintiff freely resigned his position and collected the benefits to which he was entitled, and denial of any liability in the matter, even citing prescription.
[4]
The evidence was as follows. The plaintiff had held various positions during his career in the Public Service. In around 1973, he was acting as an assistant engineer and as such assisted his superior J.M. Magnan, seeing to the preparation of work plans for the sounding and dredging section and various other related duties, including the collection of data. As such he was assigned at that period to analyse the introduction of a computerized data processing system to replace the one then being used: this led him to work in the evenings on computers owned by the Shawinigan Engineering and Alcan companies. This procedure meant substantial savings for his employer due to the lower hourly rate for computer use. At the time, a reorganization in the Department of Transport placed the section he was working for under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Coast Guard, which produced some friction regarding work practices. The work he was doing in the evenings often meant that he reported for work later in the mornings, and this was the subject of a memorandum on January 25, 1974 (P-2), and warnings from his superiors in 1977 (P-7) and 1978 (P-8). The plaintiff, who was a painstaking man intent on doing his job well, apparently preferred to write some internal memos himself rather than allowing his secretary to do it, and he was reprimanded for this (P-3) by his immediate superior J.M. Magnan on September 19, 1974. The plaintiff's submission itself set out his grievances and entered these documents in the record to establish there was very little to complain of regarding this employee.
[5]
In July 1977, after bids for dredging work to be done at Yamachiche on Lac St-Pierre were opened, it appeared that certain information contained in the contract indicating quantities to be dredged was not correct. The plaintiff was asked to discuss this matter with some of his colleagues and claimed that he had essentially been asked to change the data, to which he objected. As he regarded this as a matter of conscience and felt that his professional integrity prevented him from doing what was asked, he consulted the trustee of the Quebec Ordre des ingénieurs and his lawyer before deciding to send his employer a letter explaining his position and his refusal to comply with these instructions (P-5).
[6]
The plaintiff alleged that this incident caused a deterioration in relations with his superiors and the administrative harassment of which he was the victim. He was reprimanded, he said, for driving with an employee of the Department rather than taking a taxi (P-6) and for coming to work late in the mornings (P-7).
[7]
The plaintiff's state of health gradually became worse. As early as April 1977 he attempted to get a transfer to another job with the Public Service, but without success. He renewed his application in March 1978 (P-9), but there was no position available at the time which required his experience and qualifications.
[8]
On April 28, 1978, he sent his superiors a long letter (P-10) in which, after examining the facts at length, he stated the reasons for his resignation which was to be effective two weeks later, on May 12, 1978. He regretted this action after the date on which his resignation came effective and on May 31, 1978 asked to be reinstated (D-3); he tried again on July 10, 1978 (D-8), but all his efforts were unsuccessful: his resignation was voluntary and if he wished to work for the Marine Administration again he would have to enter a competition which was open to everyone (P-13).
[9]
On April 30, 1979, the plaintiff elected to withdraw his pension fund (D-6 and D-7), and it was not until May 1981 that he sent the Minister of Transport a notice (P-14) through his counsel. The proceedings at bar were initiated on April 29, 1982, four years after his resignation.
[10]
In his testimony the plaintiff attempted to explain his resignation by the fact that he had been subject to extreme pressure and was on the point of having a nervous breakdown. However, he went on to say that he had begun preparing his long letter of resignation in February 1978 and finally submitted it on April 28, 1978. He did consult a physician at the time - his subsequent report, dated June 27, 1978 (D-1), was entered in the record - but it did not appear that the physician advised him to take sick leave. In his report, the physician simply said that when the patient came to his office in February 1978, he spoke of stress resulting from trouble at work and the fact that his wife was pregnant, which he described as "a well-known significant life stress". The physician actually attributed his patient's condition to his inflexible personality and his tendency to insist on everything being done properly.
[11]
In March 1978, the computer data processing project on which he was working, and which required him to go to the Alcan and Shawinigan Engineering premises from time to time, came to an end. He was then told that in future he would have to observe the regular hours of other employees (P-8). The evidence also showed that as a result of the recommendations of a task force of which the plaintiff apparently was not a member, but whose conclusions he essentially endorsed, the employer finally decided to acquire a computer with operations centralized at Québec.
[12]
It appeared to the court that the plaintiff was a painstaking person with strong feelings. There is no doubt that he worked very hard on setting up this computer system, without receiving the recognition from his superiors to which he felt he was entitled, and in doing so neglected the other duties of his position. He clearly believed himself to be a victim of discrimination and this led to a personality conflict with his employers, who were attempting to impose on him discipline which he regarded simply as harassment. He even felt that he was the victim of religious discrimination because, as he was a Jew, a joke was sometimes made of the fact that Jewish religious holidays did not coincide with Christian holidays.
[13]
The plaintiff called certain fellow employees to establish the work atmosphere at the time in question. Lucien Grenier's secretary, Ginette Sickini, said that though there was not a very friendly atmosphere between the plaintiff and his superiors, she could not give any specific examples of disagreements and simply said that in general the atmosphere was normal. Mr. Gérald Proulx, a designer, knew the plaintiff well as he had worked with him since July 1969. Initially he trained with the plaintiff and said that the atmosphere was good. He stated that when the staff was centralized at Cité du Havre, certain practices had to be ended and some minor hitches had occurred, but the plaintiff had never been the victim of mistreatment. Relations between the plaintiff and his immediate superior, J.M. Magnan, were normal but he noted that it was Mr. Schecter's nature to assert and defend his rights. He described Mr. Schecter as hardworking and religious. His other superior in the organization, Mr. Lucien Grenier, was not slow to make employees aware that he was the boss, sometimes even in their presence, and this did not sit well with Mr. Schecter. The personality conflict between the two men became apparent on one occasion in 1977 when the location of a photocopier was in question: at that time, the plaintiff allegedly threatened to leave if the photocopier was not moved. The witness admitted that after Mr. Schecter left, certain other engineers took his place so that it was not true to say he was forced to leave so that his position would be abolished. The witness regarded Mr. Lucien Grenier, with whom he worked closely, as a good manager, fair, someone who kept you on your toes and who had a managerial approach. In short, he simply said that there was a personality conflict between the plaintiff and Mr. Grenier.
[14]
Mr. Elie Dawang, an employee of Shawinigan Engineering, knew the plaintiff when he worked there from time to time. He regarded him as a very painstaking person who, for example, checked the accounts sent to the Department of Transport by Shawinigan Engineering to ensure that they were correct. He confirmed that computerization work ceased at Shawinigan in 1978 and that, from that time on, the plaintiff worked on his own programs in Québec.
[15]
The witness Roland Thibault is a marine work contractor representing the company Sceptre Dredging Limited, who as the lowest bidder did the dredging work on the docking basin at Yamachiche in 1977. He stated essentially that the foreman told the contractor of considerable changes in the dredging quantities, and that in general the Department did nothing underhand. The contract provided that if the quantities were 15 percent more or less over the quantities scheduled, the unit price could be renegotiated, but this did not actually have to be done.
[16]
The plaintiff's wife, Mrs. Eleanor Schecter, described the change in her husband's personality in the summer of 1977. Whereas previously he had been very active and proud of what he was accomplishing, there were noticeable changes in his behaviour at this time. His eating and sleeping habits changed, he developed eczema and suffered from an internal infection. Her husband's attitude toward her also changed, and he became intolerant of her and of their three-year-old child. He withdrew from all social life. She said he resigned from his employment to avoid a nervous breakdown as his wife was pregnant. Immediately after his resignation, he became the same normal person as before. In cross-examination, she said of her own accord that, in her opinion, when he resigned her husband was not ill but upset by what had happened.
[17]
The defendant called only two witnesses, Messrs Jean-Paul Godin and Lucien Grenier. Mr. Godin, who is now retired, was director general of the Laurentian region at the time. He explained at length the changes made to the departmental organization at the time in question. He was also present when the Yamachiche dredging contract was negotiated and when the computer system was introduced, and he confirmed that the plaintiff's position had not been abolished as such and that it still existed. Asked to comment on why Mr. Schecter had not been invited to join the task force dealing with research into a new computerized data processing system, the witness said that they were not satisfied with the work done up to that point and that, when a few years had passed, they no longer had the necessary tools available. In short, the work done by the plaintiff had to be discarded completely and new European programs were purchased.
[18]
The witness Lucien Grenier knew the plaintiff when he came to the Department as an engineering assistant in the sounding and dredging division. The plaintiff reported to J.M. Magnan, who himself reported to the witness. He recognized most of the memos written to the plaintiff by himself or his subordinate Magnan. With regard to the computer project on which the plaintiff was working, the witness said that the intent was to improve the data collection and processing system, and for this purpose he asked Messrs Magnan and Schecter to analyse the data processing procedure with a view to reducing costs and obtaining information more quickly; finally, the aim was for the Coast Guard not to have to depend on a third party for the processing of this data. The work done by the plaintiff extended over a three-year period; it appeared that after that time satisfactory results were still not forthcoming and a task force had to be formed to speed up the process. The task force submitted its report in May 1977, and the system became operational in Québec beginning in April 1978. It was then no longer necessary to use the computers of third parties. However, the witness said, this decision did not appreciably alter the plaintiff's job description, since the time he was to spend on such work constituted about five percent of the total. There was still plenty of work for him, and he was only given the position of technician on a ship in 1978 on a purely temporary basis, replacing the team chief. In cross-examination the witness admitted that the plaintiff spent almost all his time on matters relating to data processing, but no one ever told him he was neglecting his other duties.
[19]
As a federal public servant, the plaintiff is governed by the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-32. As the evidence did not establish that he held term employment, but on the contrary had worked for the Department of Transport since 1963, he held indeterminate employment and his "tenure of office ... [was] during the pleasure of Her Majesty, subject to this and any other Act and the regulations thereunder ..." (s. 24). Section 26 of the Act lays down the procedure to be followed by an employee who resigns, namely that used by the plaintiff in his notice of resignation on April 28, 1978.
[20]
In principle, when the services of an employee in the federal Public Service are no longer required, due to lack of work or the fact that his position is being abolished, he will be laid off (s. 29). If he is dismissed for incompetence or is unable to perform his duties, the Act provides machinery by which the employee will be informed of the intention to dismiss him, and he may appeal such a recommendation. It is settled law that if the specified procedure is not followed, the public servant is entitled to claim damages from the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ). In other cases of dismissal, an employee has no right of action against the Crown for unlawful or unjustified dismissal. The courts have decided similar cases many times and held that the theory of a right to damages under a contract cannot apply to a public servant whose tenure of office is "during the pleasure of Her Majesty" (Harris, Wrongful Dismissal, 2-110;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; Peck, above;  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  there had been a breach of his contract of employment. In this sense, in light of the principles which have just been discussed, his purely contractual action would have to be dismissed. However, the plaintiff alleged wrongful acts by representatives of the defendant, and in an effort to decide exactly what there were the court has made an exhaustive study of the evidence, which it will now attempt to review in outline.
[22]
In the case at bar, care must be taken not to categorize too readily as a dismissal, whether justified or not, the circumstances associated with the plaintiff's departure. The court must not lose sight of the fact that it was first and foremost a resignation, and was presumably made in free and voluntary circumstances. Clearly, if the plaintiff wishes to obtain the damages claimed, it is for him to establish that there was harassment, arrogance - in short all the circumstances which led him to regard his departure as a forced resignation, amounting to a disguised dismissal. It is worth pointing out in this connection that the plaintiff is not asking for his resignation to be cancelled or to be reinstated in his employment, nor is he offering to repay the defendant the money received on his departure and his pension fund, the benefits of which he claimed a year later.
[23]
The plaintiff's evidence sought to establish, without too much conviction be it noted, that his resignation could have been due to his health. If the intent was to show that the plaintiff did not understand the meaning of his action when he signed his letter of resignation, the court has to say that there is absolutely no evidence to support this. No medical report from a psychiatrist was provided, and the physician's report, dated some four months after the patient's visit, did not establish that in the meantime he could have been entitled to sick leave. Even the plaintiff's wife stated that he was not ill, but depressed.
[24]
An attempt was also made to show that the plaintiff's resignation was the result of a spontaneous and unpremeditated act. The court squarely rejects this argument. The plaintiff's problems had begun appearing some time earlier, since in April 1977, a year before he officially resigned, he tried to get a lateral transfer within the Public Service. Indeed, the plaintiff himself said that he had begun writing his letter of resignation in February 1978, over two months before he decided to submit it. The style of the letter and the quantity of details and reasons contained in it can only lead to the conclusion that it was a deliberate act. Though he said he was going to resign, he nonetheless left himself a two-week period before the resignation became effective and during this period he received from Mr. Grenier a memo (D-2) refuting the reasons given in support of his resignation. There was no evidence that he then attempted to withdraw his letter of resignation. In short, his decision to resign was due to more deep-seated causes, as he indicated at the end of his letter of resignation (P-10):
"The culmination of a change in the administration has now a direct bearing on my conditions of employment. For all intents and purposes the duties as described previously have now been moved to Quebec City.
"In lieu of the above, as well as other factors not mentioned in this letter, I hereby tender my resignation as ENG2 for the D.O.T. This resignation will take effect 2 weeks from the date of this letter, in compliance with the normal procedures."
[25]
The court could find no other circumstances to support the plaintiff's allegation that his resignation was a forced one. The Department was indeed reorganized internally, and according to the evidence this produced some minor friction. At the request of his superiors, the plaintiff undertook data processing research work for which, he said, he was not given the proper credit, and which ultimately proved to be of little value to the employer: that is the fate of many a research project to which great effort may have been devoted. The evidence established that this task was only a small part of the plaintiff's duties and there were still many other areas in which he was expected to contribute. Only his frustration at seeing himself cast aside and dropped from a project which was so dear to his heart prevented him from continuing in his employment and led to his submitting his resignation.
[26]
The plaintiff submitted no conclusive evidence of the harassment and pettiness which he said he suffered. It is normal practice in an organization for the employer to issue his instructions in the form of memos reprimanding an employee if, as here, he was disregarding the working hours or the requirements of his position. With regard to these memos, it need only be said that they were spread over several years and there was nothing to indicate that they were part of a conspiracy to induce the plaintiff to resign his position. The same is true of the incident in 1977 involving the dredging contract: the contractor's representative himself admitted that the company was informed of changes to quantities and that performance of the contract was very little altered as a result. In short, the plaintiff's scruples were to the credit of his professional conscience but do not appear to have justified so much fuss.
[27]
The plaintiff did not discharge the burden of establishing that, in the circumstances, his resignation amounted to an unlawful dismissal, and his action will accordingly be dismissed with respect to items 17(a), (b), (c) and (d) of his claim.
[28]
So far as the damages to reputation, for which he reduced his claim to $10,000.00 (para. 17(e)), are concerned, the plaintiff presented no evidence of this and even assuming that he was able to do so, such a claim is subject to two-year prescription under Art. 2261 of the Civil Code. As all the events in evidence occurred between 1974 and 1978, the claim for this item brought in 1982 was manifestly prescribed.
[29]
The action is dismissed with costs.
Action dismissed.
