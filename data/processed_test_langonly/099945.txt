: This proceeding is a reference made by the applicant Minister to the court, pusuant to s. 17(2) of the Citizenship Act, S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 108 requesting that the court decide whether or not the respondent has obtained Canadian citizenship fraudulently, by false representation, or fraud, or by knowingly concealing material circumstances as denounced in s. 9 of the Act. The reference was heard at Toronto, on September 1st, 1988.
[2]
The strictly exclusive and virtually codified provisions of the Act upon which this proceeding is based run thus:
"9(1) Subject to section 17 but
notwithstanding any other section of the Act
, where the Governor in Council, upon a report from the Minister, is satisfied that any person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship under this Act by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances,
(a) the person ceases to be a citizen, or
(b) the renunciation of citizenship by the person shall be deemed to have had no effect
as of such date as may be fixed by order of the Governor in Council with respect thereto.
"(2) A person shall be deemed to have obtained citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances if
(a) he was lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances; and
(b) he subsequently obtained citizenship because he had been admitted to Canada for permanent residence.
(no emphasis in statutory text)
"17(1) The Minister shall not make a report under section 9 unless he has given notice of his intention to do so to the person in respect of whom the report is to be made and
(a) that person does not, within thirty days after the day on which the notice is sent, request
that the Minister refer the case to the court
; or
(b) the person does so request and
the court
decides that the person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
"(2) The notice referred to in subsection (1) shall state that the person in respect of whom the report is to be made may, within thirty days after the day on which the notice is sent to him, request that the Minister refer the case to the court, and such notice is sufficient if it is given by means of a registered letter addressed to the latest known address of such person.
"(3) A decision of
the court
made under subsection (1) is final and conclusive and, notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament, no appeal lies therefrom."
[3]
In this matter, by means of a Notice of Revocation of Citizenship dated July 21, 1987 (Exhibit "1" to the Notice of Reference), the Minister notified the respondent that the Secretary of State intends to make to the Governor in Council a report within the meaning of s. 9(1) of the Act. Exhibit "2" to the Notice of Reference is a copy of the respondent's request, through and by his solicitor asking that the Minister refer the respondent's case to this court. The Minister has filed a summary of facts and evidence as well as a list of documents and witnesses, pursuant to this court's rule 920.
[4]
In the meanwhile, the respective counsel for the parties conversed together, and then tendered as evidence at the hearing of this case an agreed statement of facts, now Exhibit 1. The respondent's counsel agreed to the tendering of the applicant's book of documents, now Exhibit 2, containing pertinent tabbed documents received as Exhibits 2(1) through 2(16). The agreed tendering and receipt of Exhibits 1 and 2 made it possible to proceed directly to oral arguments.
[5]
Here is the substantive agreed text of Exhibit 1:
"1. The respondent entered Canada as a visitor on July 25, 1973. He was authorized to remain in Canada until July 24, 1974.
"2. The respondent had a false immigration stamp placed in his Greek passport purporting to show that he had been granted landed immigrant status on September 24, 1977.
"3. The respondent applied for citizenship on February 18, 1982, using a forged letter dated November 18, 1981, purportedly signed by G.C. Alldridge, Acting Manager, Canada Immigration Centre, 150 Kent Street 9th Floor, Ottawa, Ontario, which letter stated that the respondent had received 'landed immigrant' status on September 24, 1977.
"4. The forged letter and passport stamp were obtained through a travel agent/immigration consultant who was operating in the Greek community in Toronto at that time. The agent held out to the respondent and others that as a consultant he had a relationship with immigration and other officials in the public service. The agent was subsequently convicted for providing false immigration documents to the respondent and others in the Greek community.
"5. On the application for citizenship, the respondent falsely stated that he had arrived in Montreal on September 24, 1977, and that he had received landed immigrant status on that date.
"6. The respondent's application for citizenship was accepted on the basis of the false documents tendered and was approved by a citizenship judge on May 12, 1982. The respondent was granted Canadian citizenship after the oath or affirmation of citizenship was made, before a citizenship judge, on June 29, 1982. The respondent received Canadian citizenship certificate no. 3216532.
"7. On March 20, 1984, the respondent pleaded guilty before and was convicted by a judge of the District Court in the Province of Ontario, on a charge that he did utter a forged document in his application for Canadian citizenship, to wit: a letter from Employment and Immigration Canada and Greek Passport number X305524 showing the holder thereof to be a Canadian Landed Immigrant, by causing or attempting to cause them to be used, dealt with or acted upon by some person or persons as if they were genuine, contrary to section 326(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada.
"8. The respondent has, therefore, obtained Canadian citizenship on the basis of false representations made in his application for Canadian citizenship and on the basis of fraudulent documents."
[6]
The documents copied in Exhibit 2 amply illustrate and give credence to those agreed facts stated in Exhibit 1. The two exhibits appear to provide the peremptory basis for the court's decision "that the person [the respondent] has obtained ... citizenship under this Act by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances ...", in the very words of s. 9(1) and s. 17(1)(b) of the Citizenship Act. However, the respondent's counsel argues that notwithstanding the foregoing possible basis of decision, this proceeding is unconstitutional.
[7]
The fundamental focus of the respondent's counsel's argument resides in s. 11(h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. That provision states:
"11. Any person charged with an offence has the right
...
(h) if finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;"
Counsel correctly asserts that the purpose of this constitutional imperative is to forbid the tyrannical abuse of State power, and to do so by exacting finality in each and every prosecution for an offence.
[8]
The respondent according to his counsel's argument was finally convicted, on a guilty plea, of the offence of uttering a forged document in his application for citizenship pursuant to s. 326(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, as the parties agree in paragraph 7 of Exhibit 1. The Crown elected to bring upon the respondent the full weight and force of the penal law by proceeding against him under the Criminal Code, instead of charging the respondent with any of the offences described in the Citizenship Act. Now, again, counsel argues, the Crown in pursuing revocation of the citizenship granted to the respondent in June, 1982, brings upon the respondent the full weight and force of the law in these proceedings by trying him again on the same offence and by seeking to have him punished by revocation of citizenship. Counsel argues that such revocation is an equally grave consequence as incarceration, if not a worse one.
[9]
In the course of argument the respondent's counsel suggested that it was improper of the Crown to switch the areas of its grievances with the respondent from the Criminal Code to the Citizenship Act. That is so, because, he urged, the whole citizenship statute, not just ss. 9 and 17, is a "code" whose integrity ought not to be fragmented by the sort of prosecutorial behaviour exhibited by the Crown toward the respondent. If, as counsel contends, the Citizenship Act be truly a code of law, it is not a seamless one. Counsel evidently forgot the emphasized expression near the beginning of s. 9 above recited: "Subject to section 17
but notwithstanding any other section of this Act
, ...". The proceedings invoked by the Crown are obviously quite legitimate according to the legislator's expressed intent. Indeed the respondent's illegal activities appear to be the very locus classicus of Parliament's legislative intent, apart from consideration of the respondent's counsel's argument on the effect of the Charter.
[10]
In support of his argument counsel for the respondent relies on the majority decision of the Supreme Court of Canada expressed by Madam Justice Wilson in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Sask.R. 105; 37 C.C.C.(3d) 385. The factual situation in the Wigglesworth case, as the applicant's counsel submitted, is entirely different from that in this present proceeding. The difference may be perceived merely upon answering Madam Justice Wilson's basic question (at p. 551 S.C.R.):
"As mentioned above, the first question to be considered is whether the appellant has been 'charged with an offence' within the meaning of the opening words of s. 11."
In Wigglesworth that question related to the major service offence of which the appellant was convicted by a service tribunal under the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R-9, prior to his facing an assault charge under the Criminal Code. Here there is no doubt in the present case that the respondent was indeed a "person charged with an offence" within the meaning of s. 11 of the Charter when he was convicted of uttering a forged document, by a judge of the District Court of Ontario, on March 20, 1984. Equally without doubt is that the respondent is not charged with
that
offence, or even
offence in these proceedings.
[11]
The respondent is not being tried again for that offence here in this court. Rather, at the respondent's own request pursuant to s. 17(1)(b) of the Citizenship Act, the applicant instituted this proceeding in which to ask the court to find, inter alia, and as the parties in fact agree, that the respondent pleaded "guilty" to that offence. That plea means that he thereby admitted all the ingredients of that offence in March, 1984. This court does not purport to try him again. He stands in no jeopardy of any penal consequence whatever as a consequence of the agreed finding. This court will not impose any punishment upon the respondent. The importance of the plea and conviction is that they provide an essential element in the decision of whether the respondent obtained citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances. This enquiry is entirely civil in nature; it is not a criminal law proceeding.
[12]
For brevity's sake here are two majority passages from the accurate headnote to English and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 384:
'... the evidence of the plea of guilty was admissible. The contention that the plea was inadmissible because it had been entered by counsel and not by the appellant, that it was only for the purposes of the criminal proceedings and that counsel's authority did not extend to that fact being treated as an admission in the present trial, is not tenable.'
'The evidence of the charge and of the plea of guilty was relevant and admissible.'"
The above mentioned judgment is relied upon by Sopinka and Lederman The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, Toronto, Butterworths, 1976, at p. 143 under the topic, "What Constitutes an Admission". The pertinent passages are:
"An admission may take many forms. A plea of guilty in a criminal proceeding or a proceeding arising out of the commission of a provincial offense, is considered an admission which is admissible as such in a subsequent civil proceeding.
...
"It should be noted that before a plea of guilty is admissible in the subsequent civil action, the latter proceeding must have arisen out of the same or similar circumstances which formed the basis of the criminal charge.
...
"In addition to the expressed admissions made by a party himself, judicial admissions made by his legal representative in court documents such as pleadings or in formal admissions to the court may be used adversely to the interests of the party."
[13]
It may also be noted that the respondent's previous admission by plea resulting in the conviction, to which facts the parties agree in this case, might in the absence of such agreement be proved pursuant to s. 12(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.
[14]
Thus, the reception of proof of the respondent's 1984 plea and conviction pursuant to the Criminal Code does not violate his right accorded by s. 11(h) of the Charter, simply because here he is, quite objectively, not being tried or punished again for the past offence. In no way does this proceeding constitute a trial for the offence of which the respondent was convicted in 1984.
[15]
Indeed, it plainly seems that access to this judicial proceeding, precipitated as it was by the respondent himself constitutes that "fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of [the respondent's] rights and obligations" which is contemplated in s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. These proceedings are not unconstitutional. That being so, the court now decides, under s. 17(1) of the Citizenship Act, upon the evidence tendered, that the respondent has obtained citizenship by false representation and fraud and by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
[16]
Counsel for the respective parties made no representations about costs and, accordingly, no costs are awarded to either party.
Order accordingly.
