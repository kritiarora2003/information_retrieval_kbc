[1]
: Both plaintiffs and defendant, as they were identified for purposes of trial on the liability issue between them, apply to this court for a review of two orders of taxation, both issued on November 15, 1994.
[2]
One order deals with the taxation of the plaintiffs' bill of costs against the defendant, wherein the taxing officer disallowed by roughly half the fees and expenses charged by the plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. David Doust. The plaintiffs had claimed for Dr. Doust's invoices spread over a period from January 31, 1984 to February 20, 1991 totalling some $42,620, and had also claimed for invoices dated August 1, 1991 and October 9, 1991 totalling $55,400. This represented a total of some $98,000. The taxing officer discounted the total by $42,620 and allowed the remainder of $55,400. The taxing officer, in this respect, felt bound by the court's Tariff that compensation for an expert witness is limited to services performed in preparation of his evidence and in giving his evidence in court.
[3]
The plaintiffs argue that the taxing officer was in error in this respect and that in the long period of time which elapsed between institution of the action in 1981 and trial of the action in 1992, Dr. Doust's services were by reason of his duties as an expert witness and all of his fees should be allowed.
[4]
I should observe at the outset that we are dealing with party-and-party costs. It is well established that parties cannot recover all their costs under that kind of award. Also, compensation of an expert witness during trial at the hourly rate allowed for preparation may be found to be too generous. Further, there is no foundation for the notion that counsel may incur any expert witness costs for which, in the event of success, they will be fully compensated.
[5]
It has been said that taxation is a form of rough justice, i.e. compounded of much sensible approximation and demanding the exercise of value judgments by the taxing officer.
[6]
In the case before me, there had been filed with the taxing officer the following invoices from Dr. Doust:
January 31, 1984 - $ 4,850
July 31, 1984 - $ 6,000
February 20, 1991 		- $12,780
(at stated $250/hr)
(at stated $1500/day)
October 9, 1991 		-
$48,448
(at stated $250 per hr) Â - $98,064
[7]
In taxing off the bill by some $42,620, the taxing officer considered that only the August 1 and October 1, 1991, invoices amounting to $55,444 were in relation to services performed in preparing to give evidence and in giving evidence. The plaintiffs see no reason why prior invoices should be excluded and argue that this constitutes an error of law which justifies the intervention of this court. According to counsel, all of the services performed by Dr. Doust are of a nature which should be fully covered by an award of costs.
[8]
Perhaps, if one should adopt a very literal interpretation of the taxing officer's comments, it might be said that there was misdirection, error of law or erroneous interpretation of what is allowable for the costs of expert witnesses. On the other hand, it could be argued that in allowing only the fees charged by Dr. Doust in his August and October 1991 accounts, the taxing officer was simply exercising a judgment call as to how much of a total bill, running close to six figures, met the test of reasonableness, a test which is imposed under s. 4(2) of Tariff A of this court.
[9]
In this respect, I would submit that in taxing any expert's bill, one must keep in mind that if the test of reasonableness is applied to solicitor-client costs, as in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , or in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), all the more so should it be applied to party-and-party costs. To repeat what was said in the
Harbour
case, no award of any kind can be interpreted as a blank cheque.
[10]
In respect of any expert witness account, there is always a risk that in responding to the test of reasonableness, a taxing officer might slight the reputation of a forensic expert who, like Dr. Doust, is well recognized and can charge for his attendance at trial much higher hourly or daily fees than those given on taxation to counsel of record. It is perhaps out of diffidence that the taxing officer decided to cut short the risk and simply allow the last two invoices submitted by Dr. Doust and tax off all the earlier ones. It might have been another way for the taxing officer to say that in his view, the total bill, on a party-and-party basis, was unreasonable, whichever way one looks at it and whichever way one decides to rationalize it.
[11]
Furthermore, I can presume that the taxing officer read both the August 1 and October 9, 1991, accounts. If in fact he concluded that the items of services performed therein cover every conceivable area of expertise which the witness was preparing for and expecting to give voice to, and preparing for and expecting to provide rebuttal evidence, that conclusion, in my respectful view, was one which the taxing officer was perfectly open to make. As I mentioned before, the exercise of any discretion cannot be easily analyzed by way of a biopsy.
[12]
In conclusion, therefore, I should find no error in the taxing officer's determination. Even if, as alleged by the plaintiffs, there might be error of law and/or fact in that determination, the same results by another approach would, in my respectful view, have been achieved.
Taxing Of Defendant's Bill Of Costs
[13]
The other order with which I am asked to deal with is in regards to the taxing of the defendant's bill of costs, where the cost of security filed pending appeal, in the amount of $30,000, was disallowed. Before the Court of Appeal, which reduced the quantum of damages awarded at trial from $1,096,060 to $906,436, the defendant-appellant was awarded one-third of its taxable costs. The defendant claims that the cost of $30,000 should be allowed on a pro rata basis of the costs award, i.e. $10,000.
[14]
I have read carefully the parties' agreed statement of facts and the written submissions of counsel for the parties. I have also listened carefully to counsel for the defendant's oral arguments before me.
[15]
The issue raised is perplexing. Is it a cost arising in the Federal Court of Appeal or at the Trial level? Is it a cost at all and can it be charged to the other party?
[16]
In her reasons, the taxing officer indicated that the $30,000 disbursed by the defendant was disallowed as it had been incurred in the Trial Division and could not be considered as a step in the appeal proceedings.
[17]
A logical argument can be made for both sides of the issue. The thrust of the defendant's submission is that the cost of the security was necessary to having the appeal heard. In fact, according to the defendant, this particular cost occurred at the appeal level since the executory judgment was rendered by the Court of Appeal rather than the Trial Division. In response, the plaintiffs submit that the posting of a bond serves no purpose in the appeal proceedings and only serves to exempt the defendant from its obligation to pay the judgment rendered at the Trial Division. The plaintiffs also submit that no costs should be allowed for the bond since the expense was neither necessary nor reasonable. In fact, the defendant was at liberty to file the amount of the judgment in court, which would have born interest at the same rate as the post-judgment allowed. Consequently, the amounts paid in excess would have been returned to the defendant following the appeal judgment, with the interest earned.
[18]
It is a long standing principle, established in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), that a court should not interfere with the discretion of the taxing officer unless he or she erred in law or the amounts allowed are so inappropriate or unreasonable that an error in principle must have been the cause. At the outset, I am of the opinion that such was not the case.
[19]
An overview of the jurisprudence relating to costs and security bonds does not reveal any case on point. However, the case-law does suggest a certain viewpoint on the matter. Firstly, I accept the plaintiffs' argument that costs incurred to cover a defendant's expenses in having its ship released, as was the case in
The Capricorn
, [1977] 2 F.C. 274; 17 N.R. 1, should be distinguished from the issue at hand. In
The Capricorn
, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the expense of giving bail forms part of the taxable costs under s. 446 of the
. That fact situation is to be contrasted with the case at hand, since the posting of the bail bond in the case of an arrested ship constitutes an appearance and declaration of the party's interest in the vessel. Secondly, in the present case, the posting of the bond was optional as security could have been paid in court. And lastly, the posting of the bond occurred after the judgment was rendered and cannot be considered as a step in the proceedings.
[20]
As such, on balance, I should find that the cost of the security is not taxable as a cost in the Federal Court of Appeal as I do not easily understand how it was incurred for purposes of the appeal. Before filing its appeal, the defendant was facing a trial judgment for damages assessed at a considerable amount. That judgment was executory and the defendant could have paid it as a debt due. The defendant decided, however, to provide security for it. It could have done so by paying the judgment debt into court and earning interest therein. At the conclusion of the appeal, that fund, with interest accrued, would have been paid out in part as full satisfaction of the judgment as amended by the Court of Appeal. It would thereafter have received the balance of it along with the remaining interest.
[21]
The defendant decided instead to go the bond route. It presumably preferred that route because it didn't affect its cash flow and the cost on a fee basis of $5 per thousand was less expensive than ordinary bank accommodation. The cost, from that point of view, was not part of the Court of Appeal proceedings and was not "a step in those proceedings".
[22]
Another approach is to determine whether the Trial judgment in favour of the plaintiffs is a final judgment or not.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), the taxing officer quotes from the
Canadian Law Dictionary
(Datinder S. Sodhi, pub., R.S. Vasan ed.) 1980, at p. 149, as follows:
"final judgment: The decision of the court which completely determines all the disputes between the parties before it and sets at rest the cause of action. The term 'final' in this context does not mean that all legal remedies are exhausted but only that,
as far as the court that is passing the judgment is concerned, the matter is at an end. If there is a superior court empowered to review the final judgment of the inferior court, the judgment may be appealed.
If the trial judgment is final, it is prima facie executory. If a defendant should wish to stay the execution by way of a bond or other surety, or pay the judgment award in court, the decision is of his own making. It is my view, in such a case, that an executory judgment at the trial level and proceedings on appeal are dissociated. Logically, if not for the executory judgment at the trial level, the posting of the security bond to stay its execution would not be necessary. As such, I cannot characterize the cost as related to the appeal.
[24]
Furthermore, the fact that the defendant chose to go the bond route instead of another option because of its financial situation is irrelevant.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  therein could not recover more that the statutory 1% since the expense was unusual and that the extra expense of a litigant due to his own impecuniosity cannot be recovered by way of costs or damages.
[25]
In light of this finding, I respectfully submit that the taxing officer did not err in law nor did she apply the wrong principle. Her decision must be confirmed.
UPON separate applications by both the plaintiffs and the defendant in this case for review of orders of taxation; and
UPON the court finding no error in the taxing officer's determination in either of the orders;
IT IS ORDERED that both orders of taxation be maintained. No orders as to costs.
Applications dismissed.
