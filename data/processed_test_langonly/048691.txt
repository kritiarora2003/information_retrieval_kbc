I The Facts
[3]
At the time in question, the applicant was an inmate in the Cowansville Institution.
[4]
On December 19, 1995, the applicant was given a written notice asking him to provide a urine sample as part of a prescribed random selection urinalysis program, pursuant to s. 54(b) of the
"54. Subject to section 56 and subsection 57(1), a staff member may demand that an inmate submit to urinalysis
(a) where the staff member believes on reasonable grounds that the inmate has committed or is committing the disciplinary offence referred to in paragraph 40(k) and that a urine sample is necessary to provide evidence of the offence, and the staff member obtains the prior authorization of the institutional head;
(b) as part of a prescribed random selection urinalysis program, conducted without individualized grounds on a periodic basis and in accordance with any Commissioner's Directives that the regulations may provide for; or
(c) where urinalysis is a prescribed requirement for participation in
(i) a prescribed program or activity involving contact with the community, or
The Notice in question indicated that the applicant had been selected at random. (Exhibit A to the affidavit of Daniel Châteauneuf, sworn on March 15, 1996.)
[6]
The applicant refused to provide the sample demanded. He was then charged with the "serious" disciplinary offence set out in paragraph 40(l) of the
"40. An inmate commits a disciplinary offence who
(l) fails or refuses to provide a urine sample when demanded pursuant to section 54 or 55;"
Section 41 of the
"41(2) Where an informal resolution is not achieved, the institutional head may, depending on the seriousness of the alleged conduct and any aggravating or mitigating factors, issue a charge of a minor disciplinary offence or a serious disciplinary offence."
[7]
On December 21, 1995, the applicant was informed that the hearing before the Disciplinary Court would be held on January 3, 1996. On January 3, 1996, the hearing was set over to January 10. (Affidavit of Daniel Châteauneuf, supra)
[8]
The applicant appeared before the Chairperson of the Disciplinary Court on January 10, 1996, accompanied by his lawyer, Ms. Vragovic, of the legal aid office, and entered a plea of not guilty. The hearing was then set down for January 17, 1996, and neither the applicant or his counsel expressed any disagreement with the selection of the hearing date. (Affidavit of the applicant, sworn on February 16, 1996, at para. 4. Affidavit of Daniel Châteauneuf, supra, at para. 9.)
[9]
On January 17, 1996, the applicant attended before the Disciplinary Court accompanied by Mr. Latour, who is also a lawyer with the legal aid office, who requested an adjournment on behalf of Ms. Vragovic because she had had to represent someone else before the Parole Board. Ms. Vragovic had learned only that morning that she had to appear in the other matter in the afternoon. The applicant pressed his right to the adjournment on the ground that he wanted to be represented by Ms. Vragovic. (Affidavit of the applicant, ibid. at para. 5.)
[10]
The Chairperson refused the adjournment, indicating that in his view Ms. Vragovic's "double-booking" was not grounds for an adjournment. He added that the witness from the Correctional Service of Canada was present and prepared to testify. (Affidavit of Daniel Châteauneuf, supra, at para. 12.) The applicant then refused to participate in the hearing on the ground that he was entitled to the services of his lawyer. (Respondent's memorandum, at para. 6.) The hearing was held despite the applicant's objections. He was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of $25. (Affidavit of the applicant, supra, at paras. 8 and 9.)
[11]
Daniel Châteauneuf, the coordinator of the urinalysis program, was present at the hearings on January 10 and 17, 1996. He acted as the designated member at the Disciplinary Court. However, he did not act as a witness and did not take part in the decision made by the Disciplinary Court. (Affidavit of Daniel Châteauneuf, supra, at para. 15.) At the time of the hearings, neither the applicant nor Ms. Vragovic, nor Mr. Latour, raised any objection to the presence of Mr. Châteauneuf as the designated member. (Affidavit of Daniel Châteauneuf, supra, at para. 14.)
(1) Did the Chairperson violate the principles of procedural fairness by failing to grant an adjournment to allow the applicant to be assisted by Ms. Vragovic during the hearing?
(2) Did the Chairperson violate the principles of procedural fairness by allowing the coordinator of the urinalysis program, Daniel Châteauneuf, to assist at the disciplinary hearing as the designated member at the Disciplinary Court?

(1) Did the Chairperson violate the principles of procedural fairness by failing to grant an adjournment to allow the applicant to be assisted by Ms. Vragovic?
(a) Relevant Statutory Provisions
[12]
Section 43 of the
"43(1) A charge of a disciplinary offence shall be dealt with in accordance with the prescribed procedure, including a hearing conducted in the prescribed manner."
[13]
The
Regulations
further provide:
"31(1) The person who conducts a hearing of a disciplinary offence shall give the inmate who is charged a reasonable opportunity at the hearing to
(a) question witnesses through the person conducting the hearing, introduce evidence, call witnesses on the inmate's behalf and examine exhibits and documents to be considered in the taking of the decision; and
(b) make submissions during all phases of the hearing, including submissions respecting the appropriate sanction.
"31(2) The Service shall ensure that an inmate who is charged with a serious disciplinary offence is given a reasonable opportunity to retain and instruct legal counsel for the hearing, and that the inmate's legal counsel is permitted to participate in the proceedings to the same extent as an inmate pursuant to subsection (1)."
[14]
Lastly, paragraphs 31 and 32 of Commissioner's Directive 580 provide:
"31. If the plea is 'not guilty', the accused inmate shall be given a reasonable opportunity to question witnesses through the chairperson, introduce evidence, call witnesses on his or her own behalf, and examine exhibits and documents relied upon. The inmate shall also be afforded the opportunity to make relevant submissions, including submissions regarding the appropriate sanction, during all phases of the hearing.
"32. The inmate's counsel shall be permitted to participate in the proceedings to the same extent as the inmate."
[15]
Commissioner's Directive 580 also provides that "the independent chairperson may adjourn a hearing when necessary", supra, at para. 27.
The applicant submits that the Chairperson violated the "audi alteram partem" rule by refusing to adjourn the hearing so that he could be represented by his counsel. According to the applicant, the Chairperson thereby prevented him from introducing evidence that could have shed light on the issues and had an influence on the outcome of the hearing.
[17]
In support of that position, the applicant submitted that:
(i) his counsel learned that she would not be available only on the morning of the hearing, when she was informed that another hearing in which she was to have taken part in the morning would be held in the afternoon;
(ii) it was common practice to grant up to two adjournments when witnesses were not available;
(iii) the adjournment was necessary in order to make a full defence on complex points of law.
According to the respondent, the presence of counsel for the applicant at the hearing could not have had any influence on the decision made by the Chairperson, since:
(i) the case law has established that paragraph 54(b) is constitutionally valid; and
(ii) no sound defence to the offence charged was likely to be raised.
[19]
The respondent also argued that the Chairperson observed the standards of reasonable limits since he had set the date with the consent of the applicant and his counsel.
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Superior Court of Quebec held at p. 738:
[Translation]
"Our courts have held on many occasions that the power of the trial judge to grant or deny an adjournment was a discretionary power and that the Court of Appeal ought not to intervene in the exercise of that power unless it clearly appears that it was exercised in an unfair and discriminatory manner. ... [A] decision denying an adjournment will be found to be unfair and arbitrary where it causes certain and irreparable harm to the party seeking the adjournment, for no fault of that party's own."
[21]
As well, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , this court held, per Denault, J.:
"The judicial discretion in relation with disciplinary matters must be exercised sparingly and a remedy ought to be granted 'only in cases of serious injustice' (Martineau No. 2, p. 360).
[22]
In short, the power to grant adjournments that is given to the Chairperson of the Disciplinary Court is discretionary, and the question that this court must ask is whether the denial of the adjournment had the effect of causing irreparable harm to the accused.
[23]
The effect of the Chairperson's refusal to grant the adjournment was to deprive the applicant of the services of his original lawyer.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  an opportunity to retain the services of counsel. The court held at pp. 738-739:
[Translation]
"Such a refusal will not in every case infringe the fundamental rights of a litigant, in that often the assistance of counsel at a hearing would clearly have done nothing to change the decision. ... If it appeared from the record ... that the evidence that the applicant intended to introduce, through his witnesses, would have done nothing to change the decision, we might perhaps be permitted to say that the arbitrator's refusal was of no consequence in respect of his final decision."
[24]
The applicant submits that the arguments that his counsel intended to present related to the constitutional validity of the section in question. (Applicant's memorandum, at p. 31.) However, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.C.A.), the constitutionality of s. 54(b) was affirmed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal. An argument challenging the constitutionality of the
, and in particular of the random selection process, would therefore likely have done nothing to change the Chairperson's decision.
[25]
The applicant also submits that the presence of his counsel would have enabled him to raise a defence based on the absence of evidence, under section 43(3) of the
. ("43(3) The person conducting the hearing shall not find the inmate guilty unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, that the inmate committed the disciplinary offence in question.") According to the applicant, it was not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the demand for a sample was made randomly. However, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), this court disposed of that argument as follows:
"The 'Notification Form to Provide a Urine Sample' is, in my opinion, proof of compliance with the requirements set out in this section of the
CCRA
. The applicant, by signing the aforementioned form, declared that he had been informed of the basis upon which the urine sample was required and further, that he understood that if he failed or refused to provide a urine sample he would be deemed to have committed a disciplinary offence under section 40(1) of the
CCRA
. I do not agree with counsel for the applicant's contention that the institution had a duty to provide the applicant with proof of the actual randomness of the selection process let alone that there be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the applicant was randomly selected. This goes beyond what Parliament intended."
In the instant case, even though the applicant refused to sign the notice, the evidence establishes that the notice was delivered to him. Beyond that, the institution did not have to prove the selection method.
[26]
On the question of the right to counsel, I note that the accused in fact had counsel present. It is therefore wrong to argue that he did not have an opportunity to make representations. In addition, it is difficult to accept that another lawyer could not properly represent the applicant, having regard to the questions that the original lawyer intended to raise.
[27]
In short, the refusal to adjourn the hearing did not cause the applicant injustice. He still had an opportunity to present his views and he refused to do so. All things considered, it is apparent that the presence of the original lawyer would have done nothing to change the decision. I therefore conclude that the denial of the adjournment did not have the effect of violating the principles of procedural fairness.
(2) Did the Chairperson violate the principles of procedural fairness by allowing the coordinator of the urinalysis program, Daniel Châteauneuf, to assist at the disciplinary hearing as the designated member at the Disciplinary Court?
(a) Relevant Statutory Provisions
[28]
Commissioner's Directive 580 provides for a member to be designated:
"19. The institutional head shall designate a member, and an alternative member of the Service, at the correctional supervisor level or above, to provide continuity and to facilitate the disciplinary process. This member shall provide assistance and any details or documents requested by the chairperson in order to facilitate the hearing.
"20. The designated member shall assist witnesses or any other persons involved in the court proceedings by providing information respecting individual roles and responsibilities in the disciplinary process.
"21. The designated member shall liaise with the accused inmate's unit staff to ensure they are aware of the case.
"22. In the event the designated member is directly involved in an incident to be heard, the member shall not act in the aforementioned position for that case."
Daniel Châteauneuf acted as the designated member at the disciplinary hearing, and he was the coordinator of the urinalysis program at the time of the alleged incident. The applicant submits that he was accordingly directly involved in the incident, and that he should therefore not have participated in the hearing. (Applicant's record, at p. 32.)
The respondent submits that Mr. Châteauneuf did not testify at the hearing and that his presence had no effect on either the conduct of the hearing or the decision of the Disciplinary Court. (Respondent's memorandum, at paras. 20-28.)
Paragraph 22 of Commissioner's Directive 580 requires that the member in question withdraw when he or she is "directly involved" in the case, which is not the situation in the instant case. The offence report that led to the hearing was written by a Mr. Gauvreau, who was also the only witness at the hearing and accordingly was the only person who was directly involved in charging the applicant. While Mr. Châteauneuf was the coordinator of the urinalysis program at the time in question, I do not believe that the effect of this was to involve him directly in the case, within the meaning of the Directive.
(3) Did the Chairperson commit a patently unreasonable error when he found that the offence alleged had been committed?
[32]
For the reasons already stated, I must conclude that it was open to the Chairperson, having regard to the evidence before him, to find the applicant guilty.
[33]
The application for judicial review is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
