[Translation]: Mr. Segasayo was Rwanda's Ambassador to Canada from 1991 to 1995. After the new government in Rwanda recalled him, he and his family applied for and were given refugee status by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) in 1996. He submitted that as a member of the Hutu Intelligentsia and as Ambassador to Canada appointed by the former government he feared persecution and reprisal by the new Tutsi government. He is now subject to a deportation order because he has been found inadmissible to Canada for violating human or international rights. This is a judicial review of that decision.
[2]
In 1998, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration designated the two Rwandan governments in power from October 1990 to April 1994 and from April 1994 to July 1994 as regimes which engaged in crimes against humanity and genocide.
[3]
That designation was made when the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, was in force. However there is no material difference between the law then and the law as set out now in s. 35(1)(b) and s. 35(2) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(
) and s. 16 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
(
Regulations
).
[4]
The relevant provisions of s. 35 of
read:
"35(1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of violating human or international rights for
. . . . .
(b) being a prescribed senior official in the service of a government that, in the opinion of the Minister, engages or has engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations, or genocide, a war crime or a crime against humanity within the meaning of subsections 6(3) to (5) of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act; or
. . . . .
"(2) Paragraphs (1)(b) and (c) do not apply in the case of a permanent resident or a foreign national who satisfies the Minister that their presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest."
[5]
Section 16 of the
Regulations
, which mirrors s. 19(1.1)(b) of the former
Immigration Act
, reads:
"16. For the purposes of paragraph 35(1)(b) of the Act, a prescribed senior official in the service of a government is a person who, by virtue of the position they hold or held, is or was able to exert significant influence on the exercise of government power or is or was able to benefit from their position, and includes
(a) heads of state or government;
(b) members of the cabinet or governing council;
(c) senior advisors to persons described in paragraph (a) or (b);
(d) senior members of the public service;
(e) senior members of the military and of the intelligence and internal security services;
; and
(g) members of the judiciary." (Emphasis added)
[6]
Mr. Segasayo sought a Ministerial Exemption under what is now s. 35(2) of
on the basis that he was not complicit in the crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide and that his permanent residence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest. The Minister refused to grant that exemption. The judicial review thereof was dismissed by Mr. Justice Blais, as he then was, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Currently before the Court is a review of his deportation order, as the Immigration Division of the IRB determined that Mr. Segasayo was a person described in s. 35(1)(a) of
The Member was of the view that the deeming provision in s. 16 of the
Regulations
created an irrebutable presumption that an ambassador in the service of a government on the Minister's list was inadmissible on the grounds of violating human or international rights. In other words, once it is shown that Mr. Segasayo was the ambassador of a government designated by the Minister (facts that Mr. Segasayo has never disputed), then he is inadmissible and has no defence based on lack of complicity in crimes against humanity or human rights violations.
[8]
The member also dismissed the argument that the provisions in question were unconstitutional as violating s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. He was of the view that the issue before him was whether or not Mr. Segasayo was inadmissible to Canada. His right to life, liberty and security of his person were not in issue because there remained other avenues open to him to avoid a return to Rwanda. Consequently, a
Charter
argument was premature.
In this judicial review Mr. Segasayo maintains that the leading case on what is now s. 35 of
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 497; 11 Imm. L.R.(3d) 296 (F.C.A.), was wrongly decided. The correct interpretation of the law is to be found in the dissenting reasons of Mr. Justice Isaac.
[10]
Once that premise is established, the rules of natural justice were violated because he had no opportunity to present his case that, despite occupying the position of ambassador, he was not in any way complicit in crimes against humanity.
[11]
In the alternative, if the courts have, to date, correctly interpreted s. 35 of
, as well as s. 16 of the
Regulations
, then those provisions are unconstitutional as they violate s. 7 of the
Charter
. It is illusory to suggest that it is premature to raise the
Charter
argument at this stage, before other avenues open to him in an effort to remain to Canada are exhausted.
As the issues raised are questions of law and of natural justice, I owe no deference to the decision maker below:
The
case, above, is somewhat peculiar. Ms. Adam attempted to sponsor her husband who had been a cabinet minister in the Somalian Government of Siad Barre. As such, he fell within s. 19(1.1)(b) of the former
which is now found in s. 16 of the
Regulations
.
[14]
In speaking for the majority, Mr. Justice Stone, with whom Mr. Justice Evans concurred, held that the presumption in the
was not rebuttable. In strong dissenting reasons, Mr. Justice Isaac held that that interpretation was inconsistent with the fairness provisions of the
Charter
and contrary to the stated purpose and objectives of the
Immigration Act
. He was of the view, and he took as an instance the specific case of an ambassador, that a person should have the opportunity to show that he or she did not exert significant influence on the exercise of government power. It was wrong to automatically bar such persons simply because their occupation was listed.
[15]
It should also be noted that the unconstitutionality of that section of the
Immigration Act
had not been squarely put in issue, and that the appellant was the Minister. No one appeared for the Adams.
[16]
During argument, I inquired how the Member below and I could choose to follow the opinion of Mr. Justice Isaac rather than that of the majority of the Federal Court of Appeal. The principle of stare decisis applies. Me Beauchemin, on behalf of Mr. Segasayo, was somewhat muted as perhaps he is saving that point for the Court of Appeal. He submitted that in any event
was distinguishable as in that case, and in all the others cited by the Minister, the individuals in question had not been granted refugee status. This distinction cannot be supported. Section 44 and following of
mean that a successful refugee claimant, like any other foreign national or permanent resident, may be declared inadmissible at any time, even if not inadmissible when refugee status was first acquired.
[17]
Mr. Segasayo's complaint is that he has not had an opportunity to make his case that he was in no way complicit in the atrocities of the Rwandan governments, and had no influence over them. Even criminals such as Mr. Chiarelli had an opportunity before a court of competent jurisdiction to defend themselves before being deported (
However, I cannot see the merit of this argument which goes to the heart of procedural fairness. Under s. 103(1)(a) of
, proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division are suspended when an officer enforcing s. 44(1) of
decides to refer a claimant's case to the Immigration Division to determine whether a claimant is inadmissible. It follows that had ambassadors of the designated Rwandan governments become inadmissible before Mr. Segasayo's refugee claim was decided, processing of his refugee claim would have been suspended while he underwent the same type of inadmissibility hearing as the one at issue here. If
, above, was followed, that inadmissibility hearing would inevitably come to the conclusion that Mr. Segasayo was inadmissible. His refugee claim would then be terminated pursuant to s. 104(2)(a) of
. He would never have had a chance to plead his case to the RPD.
[19]
, above, is binding on this Court and has been followed in cases such as
Whether another panel of the Federal Court of Appeal might have or could come to a different conclusion is not for me to say.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the Court of Appeal was called upon to interpret a provision of s. 43 of the
Federal Courts Act
. The Panel was of the view that if the matter had not already been decided it would have come to a conclusion different from a previous panel's decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The Supreme Court agreed with the legal analysis in
and refused to follow
Paramount Enterprises
: "whatever the merits of the practice" of the Federal Court of Appeal not to reverse itself, the
Panel's interpretation of the law was correct.
IS SECTION 7 OF THE CHARTER ENGAGED?
[21]
Section 7 reads:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
Having reached this stage in the analysis, the constitutionality of s. 35(1)(b) must be considered. Mr. Segasayo relies strongly on the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Section 57 of the
Federal Courts Act
provides that:
"57(1) If the constitutional validity, applicability or operability of an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of a province, or of regulations made under such an Act, is in question before the Federal Court of Appeal or the Federal Court or a federal board, commission or other tribunal, other than a service tribunal within the meaning of the National Defence Act, the Act or regulation shall not be judged to be invalid, inapplicable or inoperable unless notice has been served on the Attorney General of Canada and the attorney general of each province in accordance with subsection (2).
"(2) The notice must be served at least 10 days before the day on which the constitutional question is to be argued, unless the Federal Court of Appeal or the Federal Court or the federal board, commission or other tribunal, as the case may be, orders otherwise.
"(3) The Attorney General of Canada and the attorney general of each province are entitled to notice of any appeal or application for judicial review made in respect of the constitutional question.
"(4) The Attorney General of Canada and the attorney general of each province are entitled to adduce evidence and make submissions to the Federal Court of Appeal or the Federal Court or the federal board, commission or other tribunal, as the case may be, in respect of the constitutional question.
"(5) If the Attorney General of Canada or the attorney general of a province makes submissions, that attorney general is deemed to be a party to the proceedings for the purpose of any appeal in respect of the constitutional question."
[23]
Such a notice was given prior to the hearing at the Immigration and Refugee Board. Four provinces or territories responded. All four said they would not participate. However the Attorneys General of Ontario and of Newfoundland and Labrador reserved the right to receive further notices if the matter went to appeal or judicial review.
[24]
The Member decided that the constitutionality argument was premature, as what was in issue was not s. 7 of the
Charter
, but rather whether Mr. Segasayo was inadmissible. He would have an opportunity to make his constitutional case in later proceedings.
[25]
In this judicial review of that decision, the Attorneys General were entitled to notice in accordance with s. 57(3) of the
Federal Courts Act
. No such notice was given.
[26]
This defect could possibly have been cured by adjourning the hearing so as to give Mr. Segasayo the opportunity to serve a notice of constitutional question, and to give the Attorneys General a chance to participate if they so wished. However, like the Member, I am of the view that the constitutional question need not be answered as it is premature. Mr. Segasayo is not in detention and has other avenues open to him before he would be removed. At those times he would have his opportunity to make his
Charter
This reasoning follows that of the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  on a certified question with respect to non-admissibility of a person who was considered a member of a terrorist organization in accordance with s. 34(1)(f) of
. In speaking for the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Rothstein, as he then was, held that s. 7 of the
Charter
was not in issue. He stated at paragraph 63:
"Here, all that is being determined is whether Mr. Poshteh is inadmissible to Canada on the grounds of his membership in a terrorist organization. The authorities are to the effect that a finding of inadmissibility does not engage an individual's s. 7
Charter
rights. (See, for example,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).) A number of proceedings may yet take place before he reaches the stage at which his deportation from Canada may occur. For example, Mr. Poshteh may invoke subsection 34(2) to try to satisfy the Minister that his presence in Canada is not detrimental to the national interest. Therefore, fundamental justice in s. 7 of the
Charter
is not of application in the determination to be made under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the
See also
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
[28]
Mr. Segasayo's position, however, is that the applicability of the
Charter
is engaged now. He submits that the two prime avenues open for him to remain in Canada, an application for permanent residence from within the country on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (H&C) pursuant to s. 25 of
, and a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) pursuant to s. 112 and following thereof are illusory.
[29]
With respect to the H&C application, Mr. Segasayo suggests the result is a foregone conclusion since the Minister has already taken the position that it is not in Canada's national interest that he remain here. However the considerations which come into issue in s. 25 of
are very broad. His wife and children have been granted permanent resident status, and the Minister may waive any requirement of the
, including one supported by a previous decision taken under s. 35(2).
[30]
Turning to the PRRA, Mr. Segasayo's rights are admittedly restricted pursuant to s. 112(3)(a) of
as he has been determined to be inadmissible on the grounds of violating human or international rights. As such, by virtue of s. 114(2), if the Minister forms the opinion that the circumstances surrounding a stay of a removal order have changed, he may re-examine the case and cancel the stay. Furthermore, the principle of "non-refoulement" referred to in s. 115, i.e., that Canada will not remove a person to a country where he would be at risk of persecution or at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment does not apply to a person who is inadmissible on the grounds of violating human or international rights if the Minister is of the view the person should not be allowed to remain here "on the basis of the nature and severity of the acts committed or of danger to the security of Canada."
[31]
It seems to me that if the matter gets to that stage, and if Mr. Segasayo would still be at risk of persecution in Rwanda, he would then have the opportunity of making his case as to the nature and severity of the acts, if any, he committed or as to the danger he poses to the security of Canada.
[32]
For these reasons the application for judicial review shall be dismissed.
My decision cannot be appealed to the Court of Appeal unless, in accordance with s. 74(d) of
, I certify and state a serious question of general importance.
[34]
The issues raised are important, and it cannot be said with certainty that my own point of view is correct. I am also mindful that
was argued in the Federal Court of Appeal on an ex parte basis.
[35]
I shall certify the following question based on the one suggested by Mr. Segasayo:
[Translation] "Are s. 35(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
and s. 16 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
in accordance with the principles stated by the Supreme Court in the
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , decisions and with s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
when a person targeted by those provisions had already obtained refugee or protected person status and does not have the right to defend him/herself against the allegations made against him/her under those provisions?"
[36]
As I am of the view my accompanying order determines a question of law of general public interest or importance, these reasons are issued simultaneously in both official languages as provided in s. 20 of the
Official Languages
THIS COURT ORDERS that
:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
2. The following serious question of general importance is certified:
Are s. 35(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
and s. 16 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
in accordance with the principles stated by the Supreme Court in the
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , decisions and with s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
when a person targeted by those provisions had already obtained the refugee or protected person status and does not have the right to defend him/herself against the allegations made against him/her under those provisions?
Application dismissed.
