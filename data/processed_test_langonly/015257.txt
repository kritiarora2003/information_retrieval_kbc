: These reasons concern two appeals pursuant to s. 56 of the
Trade Marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, from two decisions, both made September 29, 1989, on behalf of the Registrar of Trademarks by hearing officer D.J. Martin of the Trademarks Opposition Board. (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.), publishes the decision concerning the opposition by  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.), also publishes the decision concerning Gillette's opposition.
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.), publishes the decision in relation to Calumet's opposition, though it inaccurately reports the date of the decision as September 29, 1990. The two decisions concern the same principal issues, differing only in the details of the statements of opposition, the evidence presented by the respective opponents, and the order of and emphasis on the grounds of opposition.) Each decision related to an opposition by the respective respondents to application no. 495,477 for registration by the appellant, Mennen Canada Inc. (Mennen), as a trademark of its distinguishing guise, its container design, for "deodorants and antiperspirants". By those decisions the application to register was refused by the hearing officer.
[2]
The application by Mennen, filed November 16, 1982, based on use in Canada since at least as early as May 1959 in association with its deodorant and antiperspirant products, depicted the distinguishing guise in "two formal drawings, one being a perspective view (on the right below) and the other a main view" (on the left), here reduced in scale to slightly less than 1/3 of the size of original drawings. Also with its application Mennen enclosed three physical specimens and three photographs of the packaging. The drawings are here reproduced.

[3]
The decision of the hearing officer and these appeals concern particularly the quality of distinctiveness required for a distinguishing guise to be registered under the
Trade Marks Act
. The decisions also raise incidentally the question of what constitutes a distinguishing guise for purposes of registration under the
Notices of appeal from the decisions on behalf of the Registrar were filed separately against the respondents Gillette Canada Inc. (Gillette) (Court File No. T-2730-89) and against Calumet Manufacturing Limited and Calumet Manufacturing Co. (Calumet) (Court File No. T-2731-89). Those respondents had separately opposed the registration of the trademark applied for by Mennen before the Trademarks Opposition Board following advertisement in the
Trade Marks Journal
of November 9, 1983, of the application, which depicted the distinguishing guise as on the left of the drawings above, i.e., "the main view". The respondents, as opponents to the application, raised the same grounds for opposition, and the same basic arguments in response to the respective appeals of Mennen, though the evidence presented by the respondents differed as did their emphasis in argument on grounds urged in opposition, and now on appeal.
[5]
The interests of the respondents differ by reason of their respective activities. Gillette sells deodorant and antiperspirant products, some in oval shaped containers, in Canada in the same markets as the appellant Mennen. Calumet Manufacturing Ltd., is an Ontario corporation, a distributor and vendor in Canada of containers, including oval shaped containers, and Calumet Manufacturing Company is its United States parent company, a manufacturer of plastic containers applied to the U.S. and Canadian markets, but neither, it appears, produces or sells deodorant or antiperspirant products.
[6]
The issues raised in the two appeals are essentially the same. Counsel for all parties arranged for efficient presentation of argument with those involved in the appeal in relation to Gillette presenting argument in full in relation to the evidence adduced at the opposition stage and for this appeal. Counsel for Calumet adopted, without repeating, the argument advanced on behalf of Gillette and concentrated on the evidence and argument insofar as it differed in relation to the appeal concerning Calumet. Because of the similarity of issues presented in the two appeals these reasons deal with both.
The Trade Marks Act
[7]
Provisions of the
Trade Marks Act
particularly relevant in these appeals include certain definitions in s. 2, and s. 13, which provide as follows:
"2. In this Act
. . . . .
'distinctive', in relation to a trademark, means a trademark that actually distinguishes the wares or services in association with which it is used by its owner from the wares or services of others or is adapted so to distinguish them,
'distinguishing guise' means
(a) a shaping of wares or their containers, or
(b) a mode of wrapping or packaging wares
the appearance of which is used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others;
. . . . .
(c) a distinguishing guise ...
. . . . .
"13(1) A distinguishing guise is registrable only if
(a) it has been so used in Canada by the applicant or his predecessor in title as to have become distinctive at the date of filing an application for its registration; and
(b) the exclusive use by the applicant of the distinguishing guise in association with the wares or services with which it has been used is not likely unreasonably to limit the development of any art or industry.
"13(2) No registration of a distinguishing guise interferes with the use of any utilitarian feature embodied in the distinguishing guise.
"13(3) The registration of a distinguishing guise may be expunged by the Federal Court on the application of any interested person if the Court decides that the registration has become likely unreasonably to limit the development of any art or industry."
The Evidence
[8]
In considering the opposition of Gillette to the application by Mennen, the hearing officer had before him as evidence that provided by Mennen in support of its application pursuant to s. 32 of the
including three specimens of its container as samples of the distinguishing guise for which trademark registration was sought, colour photographs of the packages, an affidavit of Norman Stanley-Paul, then General Manager and later President of Mennen Canada Inc., and affidavits from 126 persons from across Canada. In response to 44 affidavits completed by 33 individuals filed in opposition by Gillette, Mennen filed a second affidavit of Norman Stanley-Paul and affidavits of Don McKay, P. Chandra, John Fryer and Virginia Dotzauer; all five of these affiants were cross-examined and transcripts of those cross-examinations together with subsequently filed undertakings were a part of the record before the hearing officer. Finally, the respondent filed certified copies of 15 trademark registrations for deodorant and antiperspirant products, 12 of which were owned by the Mennen Company (the U.S. parent of the appellant), two others by Scannon Ltd. and one by Guccio Gucci S.p.A. The appellant claimed to be the registered user of all of these except Gucci, but it was not the owner of a trademark for any of the deodorant or antiperspirant products it sold.
[9]
Additional evidence was filed for this appeal, consisting of a third affidavit of Norman Stanley-Paul and the transcript of cross-examination of Mr. Stanley-Paul on this affidavit, and a second affidavit of Guy Emond and the transcript of his cross-examination in relation to that. Emond had been Project Engineering Manager for Gillette at the time of his two affidavits, the first filed by Gillette in 1984 in support of its opposition, the second sworn in February 1990, explaining the basis of statements in his original affidavit, for purposes of these appeal proceedings.
[10]
Evidence on the record before the hearing officer in the opposition by Calumet included all that filed by Mennen in support of its application, as noted above, and in reply to evidence filed by Calumet, Mennen filed four of the affidavits filed in reply in the Gillette opposition, including the second affidavit of Norman Stanley-Paul, and those of Don McKay, John Fryer and Virginia Dotzauer. Transcripts of cross-examinations of these four affiants on their affidavits, completed in the related opposition proceedings involving Gillette were also part of the record. For the opponent Calumet, affidavits of Stephen T. Pearlman, Linda Lewis, Robert L. Roebuck, Stephen H. Mayer, Marie V. Driscoll and John Sobel were filed, and certified copies of eight trademark registrations for deodorant and antiperspirant products, all in the name of the Mennen Company, the United States parent of the appellant Mennen Canada Inc., were also filed by Calumet.
[11]
The only additional evidence filed in connection with the appeal in relation to Calumet was the third affidavit of Norman Stanley-Paul, and the transcript of his cross-examination upon that affidavit, the same documents as filed in the related appeal involving Gillette.
The Oppositions And The Decisions On Behalf Of The Registrar
[12]
In their oppositions to the application by Mennen each of the respondents raised essentially the same four basic grounds though in somewhat different order and with different emphasis in accord with the evidence each had filed. These grounds were as follows.
1) The trademark applied for is not registrable because it is not a distinguishing guise in that the various aspects of the appellant's container are functional.
2) The trademark applied for had not become distinctive as of the date of filing of the application, as required by s. 13(1)(a) of the
3) The trademark applied for is not registrable because exclusive use of the distinguishing guise would be likely unreasonably to limit the development of the relevant industries, a prohibited outcome for registration under s. 13(1)(b) of the
4) The trademark applied for is not distinctive based on use by others of containers similar to that for which the appellant seeks registration, a ground of opposition based on s. 38(2)(d) of the
"A statement of opposition may be based on any of the following grounds:
. . . . .
(d) that the trademark is not distinctive.")
[13]
The hearing officer, on behalf of the Registrar, dealt with only two of the grounds of opposition. He found that the first ground was unsuccessful and that "It cannot be said that the applicant's mark is not inherently distinctive", though because of the "overwhelming functionality of all but one minor aspect of the design, it is, at best, an inherently weak guise". He then turned to the issue of distinctiveness and considered the fourth ground outlined above since, in his view, the opponents' cases were stronger at the date of filing the oppositions, the material time for considering that ground. (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 126, at 130 (F.C.A.).) Evidence before the hearing officer included fairly significant third party use of oval shaped containers for deodorant sticks which containers he described as being very similar to the appellant's, evidence of use of the appellant's containers in association with deodorants or antiperspirants marketed under two different other brand names with references to other entities than the appellant company, ambiguities from the evidence filed by the appellant including confusing identification by a number of the 126 affiants of the producer of the product sold in the appellant's container and ambiguity from two of three samples filed with the application which bore the name of the U.S. parent company and its address, with no reference to the appellant, as the source of the product. The evidence of the appellant's use of the guise showed its identity marked on the container and at the same time the trademarks of its U.S. parent company also on the container.
[14]
Based on this evidence he concluded that the opponents had respectively succeeded on the fourth ground of opposition. He summed up his decision in each case in the same way in the following penultimate paragraph:
"In view of my conclusions respecting third party use of similar containers, the inherent weakness of the applicant's distinguishing guise, the applicant's own nondistinctive use of the 'Kanon' and 'Gucci' containers, the ambiguities in the evidence filed by the applicant with the original application and the fact that the trademarks and the distinguishing guise on the applicant's containers point to more than one source, I find that the applicant has failed to satisfy the onus on it to show that its distinguishing guise is distinctive. Thus, the fourth ground of opposition is successful and the remaining grounds need not be considered."
Appeals Of The Decisions Made On Behalf Of The Registrar
[15]
The appellant's position is essentially the same in both appeals. Two general errors "in fact and in law" of the hearing officer are alleged in both appeals, those are that his decision in each case was contrary to the evidence and its weight, and that he erred in refusing to register the trademark.
[16]
More specific errors alleged in both appeals relate primarily to the hearing officer's conclusions about distinctiveness, or rather the lack of it. Thus it is urged that there was error in concluding
- that the appellant failed to satisfy the onus of showing the trademark is distinctive;
- that the onus was particularly severe where the trademark was inherently weak which, in error, was concluded to be the case for the appellant's distinguishing guise;
- that distinctiveness of the trademark was diminished by evidence establishing fairly significant third party use of oval shaped containers for deodorant sticks, which containers were considered, in error to be very similar to the trademark; it was also imperilled by the sale of "Kanon" and "Gucci" deodorants and antiperspirants in association with the trademark, and by the use of a third party's trademark (that of the U.S. parent company) in association with the guise;
- that the appellant's evidence served to point to the nondistinctiveness of the trademark rather than concluding that it pointed to distinctiveness;
- that the appellant's extensive sales and advertising in association with the trademark were not sufficient to show distinctiveness.
It was also urged that the decision in each case erred in failing to consider whether the trademark could or could not continue to function as a trademark as a consequence of use of oval containers by others.
[17]
In its notice of appeal against each of the respondents, the appellant alleges a number of facts, and in their replies the respondents deny or do not admit those which were not clearly established on the record and accepted by the hearing officer, whose relevant decision each of the respondents supported.
[18]
A matter raised by Mennen in its notice of appeal in relation to Calumet, but not in relation to Gillette, was that the Registrar erred in fact and in law in concluding that Calumet had properly pleaded the issue of distinctiveness in its statement of opposition. This matter was dealt with by the hearing officer at pages 2 and 3 of his decision (See (1990), 32 C.P.R.(3d) 216, at 219), in relation to the opposition by Calumet, quite effectively in my view, and at the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant advised that this matter was not being pursued in the appeal.
[19]
It is well settled that in considering an appeal under s. 56 of the
, while the decision of the Registrar is to be given considerable weight and not set aside lightly, this court has the responsibility to determine whether in light of all relevant circumstances the Registrar in his decision "has gone wrong" (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 199-200; (1968), 57 C.P.R. 1, at 8-9 per Ritchie,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per Pratte, J.A., at 71;
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), per Pratte, J.A., at 352). In an appeal, evidence in addition to that adduced before the Registrar may be adduced and the court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar (
Trade Marks Act
, s. 56(5)).
[20]
On appeal the onus of persuading the court that the Registrar has erred is upon the appellant, and in a case like this where the appeal is from a decision refusing an application for registration the appellant has the continuing onus of establishing that the trademark applied for warrants registration, in particular in this case by showing distinctiveness of its trademark (See e.g.,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.)).
[21]
I note that these appeals concern opposition proceedings, that there is no issue relating to alleged confusion with other trademarks of the parties or of anyone else. It is not an action for infringement or an action for expungement and, of course, there is no issue as to the validity of the appellant's trademark. The concern here is with registrability of the appellant's distinguishing guise as a trademark in light of the decisions on behalf of the Registrar, which did not deal with all grounds of opposition raised by the respondents, but was based upon finding that the appellant had failed to establish that its distinguishing guise was distinctive.
The issue to be resolved is whether or not the decisions on behalf of the Registrar erred in refusing the application to register the appellant's distinguishing guise on the ground that Mennen had not met the onus upon it as applicant to establish that its distinguishing guise was distinctive. In the case of a distinguishing guise distinctiveness through use in Canada must be established at the date of filing an application for its registration (s. 13(1) of the
), and where registration is opposed on the ground that the trademark is not distinctive pursuant to s. 38(2)(d) of the
, distinctiveness at the date of filing the opposition must also be established by the applicant (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  cannot be considered to fall within the definition of "distinguishing guise", since it cannot be said to distinguish the wares sold by the applicant from those sold by others and it would not be registrable under s. 13(1).
[23]
The hearing officer also dealt with one other ground of opposition, that the distinguishing guise claimed by the appellant was not registrable because it was comprised entirely of functional aspects and was not even inherently distinctive. After reviewing the evidence and argument, including reference to one "nonfunctional, aesthetic aspect" consisting of the slightly flattened edges of the narrower oval sides of the body and cap of the container, he concluded, "Thus it cannot be said that the applicant's mark is not inherently distinctive. Therefore, the first ground of opposition is unsuccessful." (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; see also
, 32 C.P.R.(3d) at 220.) I interpret this conclusion as finding that the distinguishing guise was inherently distinctive, at least in the sense that it was not entirely comprised of functional aspects. He did not deal with two other grounds of opposition raised and if he be found to be wrong on the issue of distinctiveness, those other grounds, not yet assessed and not dealt with in these appeals, would require determination by reference back to the Registrar.
[24]
Before turning to the primary issue, distinctiveness or lack of it, a preliminary issue raised during the hearing of these appeals warrants clarification. That is, what constitutes the distinguishing guise here at issue? I raised this question, for advice of counsel during the course of the hearing for it seemed to me that argument particularly on behalf of the appellant often appeared to be based upon the conception that the container for deodorants and antiperspirants constituted the distinguishing guise. (The decisions of the hearing officer appear to reflect this conception. In dealing with the opponent's submissions that the features of the guise were all functional, he stated:
"It is the opponent's contention that the applicant's distinguishing guise (i.e., - its product packaging) is comprised of nothing but utilitarian features." See:
This is implicit in some allegations raised in the appellant's notices of appeal in relation to both Gillette and Calumet. The notices of appeal do append as Schedule "A" a depiction of "the trademark 'Container' design ('the trademark')" said to be the subject of application no. 495,477, which depiction consists of the two drawings in the same size as earlier shown in these reasons, of the "main drawing" and the "perspectives" submitted with the application. In its notices of appeal, Mennen refers (paragraph 8) to comparisons with oval containers used by third parties as indicated by evidence, and alleges that these differed from the trademark in at least the following respects.
"(a) none of the containers have flattened edges.
"(b) none of the containers have a tappered [sic] cap and a tappered [sic] barrel.
"(c) none of the containers have a cap that overlaps and extends beyond the side of the barrel.
"(d) none of the containers have a cross-section that corresponds to the elliptical cross-section of the trademark.
"(e) none of the containers have a twist up device.
"(f) all of the containers have a different cap to barrel ratio than that of the trademark."
In its reply to notice of appeal Calumet does not admit these facts alleged by the appellant. Gillette's reply to these allegations is in the following terms:
"6. With respect to paragraph numbered 8 of the allegations of fact, the respondent denies the statements contained therein and denies the characterization of the respondent's evidence and the extent of use of such third party containers is in evidence. The containers bearing the trademarks 'Kannon' [sic] and 'Gucci' are identical in the appellant's alleged trademark.
"The container attached as Schedule A does not clearly have a tapered cap or tapered barrel nor does it clearly have a cap that overlaps and extends beyond the side of the barrel. A container not having a tapered cap or barrel would be confusing with appellant's alleged trademark.
"All of the said third party oval containers has a height to width ratio corresponding to the container depicted in Schedule A.
"7. The respondent denies that Schedule A properly identifies the trademark to be covered by application serial number 495,477."
[25]
When the matter was raised at the hearing counsel for the appellant urged that the distinguishing guise here in question was the container itself, in light of the definition of "distinguishing guise" in s. 2 of the
. Alternatively it was urged that the drawings submitted (and it was said the Registrar chose only to advertise one of them) and the three samples filed with the application constituted the distinguishing guise under the
. The respondent Gillette, urged that the distinguishing guise in issue was that submitted as the main drawing (subsequently advertised) with the Mennen application, not the container itself. That was the trademark which would be registered, not the sample containers or coloured photographs also submitted with its application by Mennen. I note that no colour symbol is designated with the drawing and no words describing the container are found in the application or with the drawing, at least so far as I can discover, to verbally describe or define the distinguishing guise.
[26]
In my view, the
provides for registration of a distinguishing guise, through application, in the same manner as for other trademarks. Unless the mark consists solely of a word or words without particular style, the
requires that a drawing of the trademark and accurate representations of it be filed with an application for registration (Section 30 of the
provides for the contents of an application, including
. . . . .
"(h) unless the application is for the registration only of a word or words not depicted in a special form, a drawing of the trademark and such number of accurate representations of the trademark as may be prescribed; ...")
It is the mark so depicted in the drawing, reproducible with a certificate of registration, which then provides notice to the world of the owner's or registered user's proprietary interest in the trademark and which forms the evidentiary basis for actions of infringement or for expungement. Useful as photographs and samples of a trademark, including a distinguishing guise, may be upon application for registration, to ensure the drawing is a reasonable representation of the trademark claimed, in my view those do not form part of the trademark for registration or for other purposes under the
On this preliminary issue, I find that the distinguishing guise in issue in these appeals is that depicted in the drawing submitted for registration purposes and which was advertised. It is not the container itself, even though that is in fact the guise in which the appellant's deodorant and antiperspirant products are sold, for the container itself can only be a sample representation of the distinguishing guise for registration of which application was made. In my view it is this conception of the distinguishing guise here in issue that must be borne in mind when assessing the arguments of the parties, and the decision made on behalf of the Registrar.
Considerations
[28]
A variety of matters were addressed in these appeals. Among them were some which relate to grounds of opposition not decided by the hearing officer. Thus, for example, both respondents submitted that allowing the application would result in a monopoly for the appellant in relation to oval shaped containers. They were concerned with the prospect of action by the appellant against other users of containers, with serious adverse implications for those in the business of supplying containers and those selling deodorant and antiperspirant products in oval shaped containers. For the appellant, counsel affirmed there was no intent to claim a trademark in all oval shaped containers, rather the application was for a trademark in the appellant's container, its distinguishing guise. For Gillette it was urged that the application did not conform sufficiently to the appellant's distinguishing guise, that the guise as represented inadequately defined the appellant's container and was too vague in its representation of that. These submissions concern issues of the likelihood of unreasonable limitation on the development of the relevant art or industry, and also of the adequacy of the application. The first was a ground of opposition not dealt with by the hearing officer and the second was not directly raised at the opposition stage or dealt with in the decisions.
[29]
In my view only those matters dealt with by the hearing officer in his decisions on behalf of the Registrar are relevant in these appeals. There are two matters, raised in opposition and dealt with in the decisions: that the distinguishing guise is not registrable since it is entirely utilitarian or functional, and that it is not registrable since the appellant failed to discharge the onus of establishing that the distinguishing guise is distinctive. On the latter basis the application was refused.
[30]
On the first of the matters dealt with, the functional attributes of the distinguishing guise, there was much argument in the appeal relating to Gillette. The appellant argued that the hearing officer was in error in considering separate aspects of the guise, the oval shape, the cap, the knob mechanism at the base used for turning to raise or lower the contents of the container, each in turn and each as functional, with the only aspect not considered to be functional being the narrow flattened edges of the oval barrel and cap. It was urged that the assessment must be made in relation to the guise as a whole. I agree that it is the whole of the mark which is to be considered in assessing distinctiveness (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), at 183-184); the overall impression upon the members of the public to whom the wares are offered for sale (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the hearing officer, in considering functional attributes in turn, was in direct response to the evidence adduced and argument advanced by the opponents, and it was an appropriate approach in his assessment of the relative strength or weakness of the trademark sought to be registered. The approach did not preclude his overall assessment, that the distinguishing guise was not exclusively functional. Though he expressed it in negative terms, i.e., "... it cannot be said that the applicant's mark is not inherently distinctive", I consider that he did find that it was inherently distinctive and that the opposition on the ground that it was not registrable because it was entirely functional was not successful.
[31]
Considerable argument was addressed by counsel for the respondent Gillette to the functionality of the one feature that the hearing officer concluded was not established by the evidence before him, that is, the narrow flattened edges of the appellant's container. There was additional evidence adduced for this appeal on this matter, the second affidavit, and transcript of cross-examination upon it, of Guy Emond. That evidence does not, in my view, support Gillette's argument that the flattened edges were a functional aspect of the distinguishing guise. Rather, in my view, it undercuts that argument for Emond's later evidence makes clear that his earlier averring of the functional purpose of the flattened edges, for facilitating production line conveyor belt filling mechanisms for putting product into the container barrel, was based on earlier conceptual planning, never realized, within Gillette's operations for another size of container for another product. The evidence for Mennen was clear that the flattened edges of the barrel and cap had no functional purpose in their production process. Moreover, it is clear from Mennen's evidence that the slightly tapered barrel of its container resulted in only the top of the two barrels touching when placed so that the narrow oval sides butted. I am not prepared to accept the submission of counsel for Gillette that merely because Mennen did not utilize the functional advantage which flattened ends might provide to others in a manufacturing process did not mean that aspect was not functional. There was no evidence of any use of that aspect of the guise by anyone in the manner here suggested by Gillette. Finally, other possible functional purposes, for arranging the product on the shelf and for holding the container without slipping, were not supported by any substantial direct evidence.
[32]
Thus, on this matter, I am not persuaded that the hearing officer was wrong in concluding that the guise was not entirely functional and that it was inherently distinctive in that sense.
[33]
On the second ground dealt with, the appellant urges that the decisions appealed from erred in several ways in not finding the distinguishing guise to be distinctive. I turn to these arguments in turn.
[34]
First, it is urged that by his approach of considering the particular attributes and their functionality, rather than the mark as a whole, the hearing officer's conclusion that the guise was inherently a weak trademark was in error. His conclusion was based upon his assessment that so many of the attributes were functional. I have noted that his approach in considering various features was appropriate in dealing with the evidence and arguments of the respondents. If one considers the distinguishing guise as presented in the appellant's application for registration the features considered by the hearing officer, i.e., its oval shape, the cap, the knob or screw device at the base and the narrow flattened edge strips on barrel and cap, he has examined all of the features readily apparent to the eye. Many of the features referred to by Mennen in its notice of appeal as set out earlier in these reasons, and referred to by counsel at the hearing of these appeals, referring to the container itself, i.e., its tapered shape, its cap overlapping and extending beyond the barrel, the cap to barrel ratio, are simply not evident to the eye from the distinguishing guise as represented by the appellant in its application and its drawings. Nor would they be readily apparent to a member of the general public to whom the products were offered for sale, even from the containers themselves, without an initial explanation. In any event there is no evidence these features, or the flattened edges, were apparent to purchasers in the market and they are not referred to in the 126 affidavits filed by the applicant from persons who averred they were familiar with the Mennen container or its shape, which a number of the affiants do in contrast with the round containers used by the others.
[35]
I am not persuaded that the hearing officer erred in concluding that the distinguishing guise, as presented in the drawing submitted by the appellant with its application for registration, was an inherently weak mark.
[36]
The appellant also submitted that the hearing officer erred in considering the evidence of third party use of oval containers as significant. The evidence is clear that others used oval containers for deodorant and antiperspirant products sold in Canada since at least 1977. It is urged that the containers used by third parties are not similar to the trademark in overall appearance. While the oval containers used by others may differ from the oval containers used by Mennen, in my view, they are not so clearly different in overall shape and features from the drawing submitted by the appellant with its application that I am persuaded the hearing officer was wrong in considering them, as he did, to be "similar" or "very similar". The others are oval in shape and they have a cap in about the same proportions to the barrel as the drawn distinguishing guise does, though most do not have a knob or screw mechanism in the base. Nor am I persuaded by the appellant's argument that third party use should be considered nominal compared to that of the appellant and therefore be disregarded in assessing the distinctiveness of the appellant's guise. I acknowledge the evidence shows third party use of oval containers in Canada began considerably later than the appellant's first claimed use of its distinguishing guise. Also, the evidence of comparative sales and advertising expenditures, so far as that is in evidence from third parties, clearly demonstrates substantially greater sales and advertising, and a significant market share for Mennen, greater than all of the other products combined for the years 1977 to 1984. Yet for that period, tables provided by the appellant show, on incomplete data for others, that unit sales by third parties were about 10% of the Mennen total for its products. That share is not so insignificant in my view that it should be disregarded in assessing whether the appellant's distinguishing guise is distinctive.
[37]
The hearing officer was also said to have erred in his determination that the appellant's claim to distinctiveness was imperilled by use of its container with wares that appeared to be those of others. The evidence is that "Kanon" deodorant and antiperspirant products were sold in association with the Mennen distinguishing guise and their containers appeared with the trade name Scannon Ltd./Ltee and a Mississauga address with no reference to the appellant. On average total sales of these products were 14,500 units from 1970 to 1983. In addition, the appellant sold some 1,000 units of "Gucci" brand deodorant contained  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> 's container from June 1983 to 1984, the period between the date of filing its application and the date of filing the oppositions. These containers also made reference to Scannon Ltd./Ltee but not to the applicant. These sales were said to have been made in individual boxes and the distinguishing guise was said to have been used merely to meet a shortage in supply of the usual round container. The appellant contends that sales of these products were so minor compared with the volume of sales of its regular products in association with the distinguishing guise that they should not diminish the distinctiveness of the trademark. They rely on
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.M.O.B.), at 489-491. Yet I note the hearing officer in these decisions referred to that case and noted "In the absence of additional evidence, such activities might have been insufficient, in and of themselves, to negate the distinctiveness of the applicant's mark ... But, in the present case, they appear to be just one of several factors at play." I would agree that it was not wrong to consider the use of the appellant's distinguishing guise with these products in assessing distinctiveness of the guise.
[38]
The respondent Gillette urges that it was contrary to Ontario law for the appellant to carry on business under the name Scannon Ltd., the name of a United States company also affiliated with the parent Mennen company. That is not a matter at issue here and there was little evidence of any such activity. In my view the issue raised by this use of the appellant's container, for which it seeks to register a distinguishing guise, which by definition under the
is for the purpose of distinguishing the appellant's wares from those of others, is whether that use does imperil or diminish the claim to distinctiveness.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  register when it was established that the holder of the trademark, before applying to register, had used his word mark on boxes with the names of others and no reference to his own manufacture of the wares, in that case cigarettes. The decision was based upon the conclusion that the mark could not have acquired a secondary meaning referable to his goods when the owner of the mark had destroyed that opportunity by sales with his mark but in association with wares that to the public appeared to be those of others. The underlying principle is that where one holds out to the interested public that other's wares, not only those of the person later claiming a trademark, are sold in association with the mark, then the person seeking registration of the mark has weakened, if not completely undercut his claim to distinctiveness in the trademark. This is the principle supported by
Moore  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 40 (F.C.A.), where the court concludes that the action of associating the mark with wares that appear to be those of others may constitute deceit in deliberately seeking to mislead the public and a claim to distinctiveness would appear to be destroyed (Id.). The evidence in this case does not go that far. Nevertheless, it is my view that the hearing officer rightly considered that the appellant's own conduct "imperilled" or diminished its claim to distinctiveness of its guise by using or permitting use of what it claimed as a distinguishing guise with products that appeared to prospective purchasers to be produced by others, and without any reference to the appellant.
[39]
Ambiguities in evidence presented by the appellant concern principally two matters. The first was the identification of the source of the wares by the 126 affiants whose affidavits speak to their recognition of the appellant's distinguishing guise. The majority of them identify the source of the product as the Mennen Company, the name of the U.S. parent company, and most of the others identify the source as the Mennen Company Ltd. The name of the appellant, Mennen Canada Inc., is virtually ignored by the affiants. The second matter related to two of the three samples filed by the applicant as samples of its distinguishing guise, which two samples identify the source as the U.S. parent company with its address.
[40]
Both these matters were addressed in the third affidavit of Mr. Norman Stanley-Paul, for the applicant, upon which he was cross-examined. This evidence, produced for these appeals, was directed to addressing the concerns of the hearing officer about the evidence adduced by the applicant. On the first matter, the added evidence is that the appellant's name was changed from the Mennen Company Limited to Mennen Canada Inc. in November 1980, only two years before the application for registration was filed. While the company began to issue products with its new name when its name changed, not all its products were produced at one time and it had little control over inventory in the distribution and retail markets. It was estimated some products with the former company name would still have been available in the market place up to two years after the name change, even though the average time of product turnover was estimated at six months. While I agree with counsel for the appellant that there is no requirement for the consumer to know the name of the source of the product, it does not greatly assist the appellant's claim to distinctiveness of its trademark, when names of other entities are cited in the evidence it adduces as the source of the wares. While there was no cross-examination of the 126 affiants and no evidence of the manner in which these affidavits were collected, the assessment by the respondent Gillette was that some 35 were sworn by lawyers, law students or legal secretaries and another 35 by persons engaged in the trades selling the wares and that the general form and content of the affidavits indicated some overall co-ordination in their preparation. This assessment went unanswered and while I do not accept it as necessarily definitive it does raise serious question about the weight to be given to the affidavit evidence tendered to support the claim to distinctiveness.
[41]
Similarly, while I do not question the explanation by Mr. Stanley-Paul that the two containers identifying the U.S. parent as the source of the wares were filed in error, that error is of the appellant's own making and it was part of the evidence before the hearing officer. In my view he was not in error in assessing this as part of the evidence submitted by the appellant, and affecting the weight of that evidence, in relation to the claim to distinctiveness.
[42]
The appellant further contends that the hearing officer erred in considering the use of another party's trademarks, i.e., those of the U.S. parent company which is the registered owner of the trademarks for the deodorants and antiperspirants, on the container, as imperilling the claim to distinctiveness. In this regard both decisions appealed from state in part (See
"Another factor imperilling the distinctiveness of the applicant's mark is the use of another party's trademarks on the packaging. There are a number of exhibits in the evidence which show the applicant's container with the applicant's name Mennen Canada Inc. on the back of the container. However, the various trademarks on the front of the container are registered in the name of the U.S. company, The Mennen Company. Mennen Canada Inc. is recorded as a registered user of those registered marks and therefore any use of those marks by Mennen Canada Inc. accrues to the benefit of The Mennen Company. And use by the registered user is use by the registered owner for all purposes of the
including distinctiveness: see
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(2d) 16 (S.C.C.). On the other hand, the only party identified on the Canadian container is Mennen Canada Inc. This points to the applicant as the user and owner of the distinguishing guise. In such a circumstance, it is difficult to see how the distinguishing guise can distinguish the applicant's wares (being the deodorant in the container) from those of others when another company's trademarks are being used on the container to perform the same function for that other company. In the absence of some explanatory labelling, it would seem that the applicant's own activities have undermined the distinctiveness of the distinguishing guise. ..."
[43]
In my view the
S.C. Johnson
case relied on by the hearing officer, does not deal with a situation of so-called double trademarking, as the appellant points out, rightly in my view. Rather, it concerns the issue whether use by a registered user may actually distinguish the wares of the registered owner, thus preserving the rights of the owner under the
. Here the Mennen trademarks, owned by the U.S. parent company, or by Scannon Limited, were used by the appellant, the Canadian company, as registered user. It was the only user of those marks in Canada and the only wares bearing those marks in the Canadian market originated with the appellant as registered user. The use by a registered user is authorized by the
(see generally s. 50). The
does not require a registered user to indicate his status as such in relation to his use of the trademarks in association with the wares for which his use is registered. In my view s. 50(3), upon which
S.C. Johnson
is based, which preserves the position of the registered owner through permitted use by a registered user does nothing to preclude use by the registered user. Nor should it be seen as a bar to, or a diminishing of, a claim to distinctiveness in a distinguishing guise sought to be registered by the registered user for use in association with wares the trademarks for which he is the registered user. It seems to me this is the purport of the comments of Thurlow, A.C.J., as he then was, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 129-130 (F.C.T.D.). A situation somewhat similar to that in these appeals, at least in relation to "double marking" was dealt with by the Registrar of Trademarks who commenced (
Land-O-Nod Co. and Beverley Bedding and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 136 (T.M.O.B.):
"... The
does not require a registered user to indicate in any way on his goods that he is using the trademark as a registered user. It is inconceivable that it was not in the minds of the framers of the legislation that a registered user would use both the licensed mark and one or more of his own marks on his goods at the same time. It would, in my view, be too mechanical an interpretation of s. 49(3) [now subs. 50(3)] and would too seriously frustrate the purpose of that provision to hold that in such circumstances the applicant's marks - and perhaps the licensed mark as well - become nondistinctive. ..."
[44]
In sum I do not think it diminishes the appellant's claim to distinctiveness of its guise, that it uses the guise in association with wares the trademarks of which it is the registered user. Thus on this point I believe that the hearing officer erred.
[45]
As a final submission the appellant urged that the evidence of its extensive sales of deodorant and antiperspirant products ought to have been accepted by the hearing officer as a basis for finding distinctiveness of the guise for which registration was sought. The respondents questioned certain aspects of that evidence but that does not, in my view, negate the overall picture of substantial and generally increasing sales of the appellant's products, at least in the years since 1977 in association with the distinguishing guise. Yet I am not persuaded that the hearing officer was in error in considering that evidence to be but one factor to be weighed in light of the evidence on other factors affecting the claim to distinctiveness.
Conclusion
[46]
While I have disagreed with the assessment by the hearing officer of the effect of use of the trademarks of the registered owner, of which the appellant was the registered user, on the containers which also identified the appellant, I am not persuaded that on any other aspect of his decisions he was in error. Thus, I do not conclude that he was wrong in finding the distinguishing guise as applied for was a weak mark, or in finding that there was significant use by third parties of oval containers which in appearance were similar to the guise as depicted by the appellant, or that the appellant's claims to distinctiveness were adversely affected by its use of its guise in association with "Kanon" and "Gucci" wares in a manner that would appear to a potential purchaser in the market place to be wares of some third parties, and by ambiguities in the evidence submitted with the application, the 126 affidavits and the sample containers, ambiguities which were within the power of the appellant to eliminate before the evidence was submitted.
[47]
The hearing officer weighed the evidence before him on all of the factors raised relating to the distinctiveness of the distinguishing guise as applied for registration by the appellant. In my view he was not wrong in concluding that the appellant had failed to discharge the onus of establishing that the guise was distinctive. Further, the additional evidence adduced in these appeals, does not, in my view, significantly change the circumstances on which the issue of distinctiveness is to be weighed, nor does it significantly affect the weight of evidence considered by the hearing officer.
[48]
I conclude that the appellant has not met the onus of establishing that the decisions on behalf of the Registrar were wrong.
[49]
The appeal in each case against the decision concerning opposition by the respective respondents is dismissed. A copy of these reasons is filed with each court file and a separate order dismissing the appeal, with costs, goes in each appeal.
