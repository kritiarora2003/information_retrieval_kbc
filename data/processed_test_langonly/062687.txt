[Translation]: This is an application for judicial review from a negative decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board") dated August 31, 1994.
Facts
[2]
The claimant is a citizen of Afghanistan and was born in 1939. In 1960, after completing his studies at Afghanistan's police academy, he began his career as a police officer. Until 1973 he worked as a police officer, the first two years outside the capital Kabul and then as police deputy (
In July 1973, Afghanistan's monarchy was overthrown by the Daoud government and, in October 1973, the claimant was appointed chief of police of the city of Herat.
[4]
The claimant returned to Kabul in 1976 after being appointed deputy director of Kabul's Deh Mazang central prison. As deputy director of the central prison, the claimant was responsible for the prisoner's industrial production.
[5]
On April 27, 1978, the Daoud government was in turn overthrown in a "coup d'état" led by Babrak Karmal of the Parcham faction of the Afghan communist party. In mid-May 1978, the claimant was appointed director of the central prison by the new regime, which included colleagues and friends of his.
[6]
Shortly after taking power, the new regime declared an amnesty for prisoners detained in the central prison. Of 500 prisoners, some 300 were released under this amnesty. The other prisoners were then transferred to a new prison, Pol El Charkhi. The Deh Mazang prison was subsequently closed due to its poor condition.
[7]
In July 1978, the Khalq faction of the Afghan communist party took power and the leaders of the Parcham faction were pushed aside. Even though the claimant had been identified by the Khaiq faction as a "sympathizer" of the Parcham faction, he was, in the fall of 1978, appointed deputy commandant in Vazekha, located near the border of Pakistan. The claimant now reported to the Ministry of the Interior and his duties consisted of training police officers and ensuring the security of the Afghan border.
[8]
In early May 1979, the mujahedeen took control of the Ghazni border region near Pakistan, where the town of Vazekha is located. The claimant was arrested and detained. He escaped, reaching Kabul on June 17, 1979. Suspected of treason, he was on his return imprisoned in the Pol El Charkhi prison. On December 25, 1979, the Parcham faction regained power with Russian support. The claimant was released from prison on January 14, 1980.
[9]
In April 1980, the claimant was appointed investigating officer for the general command of the Kabul police. According to him (see paragraphs 1.26, 1.27 and 1.28 of his memorandum), his duties in this position were the following:
[Translation] "1.26 His duties then consisted in acting as a liaison between the country's capital and regions and more specifically in reporting to the Kabul police authorities on the state of recruitment of forces in the regions, the condition of the mujahedeen forces in the regions and the administration of the region;
"1.27 Recruitment in the regions, on which the applicant was required to report, often consisted in the mandatory conscription of children even under age 14 who were sent to fight the mujahedeen;
"1.28 The applicant had to go to all regions for the purpose of making these reports, which was dangerous work since the mujahedeen were fighting government forces in a number of those regions;"
[10]
The claimant held this position until July 1988, that is, for eight years. In that month, the Khalq faction of the Afghan communist party, led by Dr. Najibullah, took control of the region where the claimant was. He and a number of supporters of the Parcham faction were then arrested and detained. The applicant was imprisoned in the Pol El Charkhi prison from July 7, 1988 until February 1989, during which period Russia withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.
[11]
There was an attempted "coup d'état" in March 1990 and the applicant was arrested on March 17, 1990 by supporters of Dr. Najibullah, who suspected him of participating in the attempt. The claimant remained in prison for 13 months.
[12]
In September 1991, the claimant left his country for Pakistan. He arrived in Canada in March 1992 and claimed refugee status.
The Board's Decision
[13]
As I mentioned above, the Board rendered a decision unfavourable to the claimant on August 31, 1994. More specifically, it held that the claimant was not a Convention refugee.
[14]
The Board began by accepting the truthfulness of the claimant's evidence that he had been a police officer, prison director and investigator during the period when the communist regime was in power in Afghanistan. It accordingly found that, in view of his past and of the mujahedeen's determination to take revenge, there was a risk of persecution if the claimant were to return to Afghanistan.
[15]
The Board then found that the claimant, as prison director, [Translation] "was aware of the dangerously unhealthy conditions of the prisoners for whom he was responsible ...". It also found that the claimant, when serving as an investigating officer, co-operated with the regime in power to conscript young men aged 14. In its decision, the Board stated the following:
[Translation] "For eight years he sent reports that enabled the government to control activities in the provinces, including the conscription of defenceless youths against the mujahedeen."
[16]
The Board accordingly held that the claimant should be excluded despite the danger of persecution should he return to Afghanistan. According to it, the claimant should be excluded because he is a person to whom the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
does not apply pursuant to section F of Article 1 thereof.
[17]
The Board specifically found that the claimant is a person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed a crime against humanity or has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[18]
Finally, it should be noted that the Board found the claimant not to be credible on the subject of his responsibility as a prison director and investigating officer. At page 4 of its decision, the Board stated the following:
[Translation] "The Board might find that the claimant's testimony lacked credibility and that he tried to minimize his various roles in order to reduce his moral responsibility. However, the Board should determine whether the claimant's co-operation with Afghanistan's communist regime, specifically as described, did not make him a person who must be excluded for the reasons elaborated upon by the Minister's representative."
The only issue is whether the Board erred in holding that the claimant should be excluded from the definition of "Convention refugee".
The Board's first conclusion was that there was a risk of persecution if the claimant were to return to Afghanistan. The respondent does not challenge that conclusion.
[21]
Its second conclusion was that the claimant, as a prison director and investigating officer, should be held responsible for the ill treatment suffered by prisoners detained in the prison of which he was the director and for the conscription of children and teenagers aged between 10 and 17 to fight against the mujahedeen.
[22]
On the basis of its second conclusion, the Board held that the claimant should be excluded because he is a person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed a crime against humanity or has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In other words, the Board held that the
Convention
does not apply to the claimant because his conduct excludes him from its protection.
[23]
The definition of "Convention refugee" in s. 2(1) of the
Immigration Act
(the "
") ends as follows:
"... but does not include any person to whom the Convention does not apply pursuant to section E or F of Article 1 thereof, which sections are set out in the schedule to this Act ..."
[24]
Section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
reads as follows:
"F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
(b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
(c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations."
[25]
Concerning section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
, paragraph 149 of the
Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees
("the
") published by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reads as follows:
"The competence to decide whether any of these exclusion clauses are applicable is incumbent upon the Contracting State in whose territory the applicant seeks recognition of his refugee status. For these clauses to apply, it is sufficient to establish that there are 'serious reasons for considering' that one of the acts described has been committed. Formal proof of previous penal prosecution is not required."
[26]
Along the same lines, Grahl-Madsen wrote the following in
The Status of Refugees in International Law
(Leyden, Netherlands: Sijthoof, 1966), Vol. 1, at pages 277 and 289-290:
"In order to be excluded from the scope of the Refugee Convention by virtue of Article 1 F a person need not be convicted for any of the crimes enumerated therein; it suffices - as we have already mentioned in (par.) 100 - that 'there are serious reasons for considering' that he has committed such a crime.
"The words 'serious reasons for considering' make it clear that it is not a condition for the application of article 1F (b) that the person concerned has been convicted or formally charged or indicted of a crime. The person's own confession, the testimonies of other persons, or other trustworthy information may suffice."
[27]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Federal Court of Appeal quoted Grahl-Madsen's comments with approval at page 311. In addition, at pages 311-313, the court gave a clear explanation of the meaning of the words "serious reasons for considering" found in the introductory paragraph of section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
. MacGuigan, J.A., writing for the court, stated the following:
"In the case at bar, the appellant has never been formally charged with a crime, and it was his own evidence which the Refugee Division used against him to exclude him, an approach in conformity with the
Convention
.
"The words 'serious reasons for considering' also, I believe, must be taken, as was contended by the respondent, to establish a lower standard of proof than the balance of probabilities. The respondent indeed argued that 'serious reasons for considering' should have the same meaning as the phrase 'reasonable grounds to believe', which is used again and again in s. 19 of the
with respect to inadmissible classes of persons. The most closely related class is that described in paragraph 19(1)(j) [as enacted by R.S.C., 1985 (3rd Supp.), c. 30, s. 3], which applies generally to all immigration claimants:
'19(1) No person shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:
(j) persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe have committed an act or omission outside Canada that constituted a war crime or a crime against humanity. ...'
"The same result is provided for by paragraphs 27(1)(g) and (h) for persons who are already permanent residents, and by subparagraph 46.01(1)(d)(i) [as enacted by R.S.C. 1985 (4th Supp.), c. 28, s. 14] for persons who claim to be Convention refugees: both of these latter provisions merely refer to persons described in paragraph 19(l)(j), and so incorporate the notion of 'reasonable grounds to believe'.
"While I see no great difference between the phrases 'serious reasons for considering' and 'reasonable grounds to believe', I find no necessity exactly to equate the one with the other, although I believe both require less than the balance of probabilities. 'Serious reasons for considering' is the
Convention
phrase and is intelligible on its own. Nevertheless, the comparison with paragraph 19(1)(j) shows that Parliament was prepared to contemplate a standard lower than the usual civil standard in this case. Moreover, it also leads me to think that it would be extremely awkward to place one standard at the ordinary civil level, and another, for what is essentially the same thing, at a lower level.
"Therefore, although the appellant relied on several international authorities which emphasize that the interpretation of the exclusion clause must be restrictive, it would nevertheless appear that, in the aftermath of Second World War atrocities, the signatory states to this 1951
Convention
intended to preserve for themselves a wide power of exclusion from refugee status where perpetrators of international crimes are concerned."
[28]
Thus, to exclude a person under Article 1 of the
Convention
, the Minister is not required to show that the person has been convicted of or charged with a crime. It is enough for the Minister to establish that there are "serious reasons for considering" that the person in question committed the crime; what is more, the burden of proof on the Minister is less than that of the preponderance of evidence.
[29]
In another judgment in
Moreno and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at page 308, Robertson, J.A., of the Federal Court of Appeal referred with approval to the comments made by MacGuigan, J.A., in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . After quoting MacGuigan, J.A.'s, comments, Robertson, J.A., stated the following at page 309:
"'the less-than-civil-law' standard referred to in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is consistent with the intent of the signatories to the
Convention
who were adamant that international protection be unavailable to war criminals; see generally
Hathaway
, supra, at pp. 214-217. However, it may well be that in strict legal theory the exclusion clause should be construed as erecting a threshold test to be met by the Minister rather than prescribing a standard of proof per se. This view was advanced in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), an earlier decision of this court, which considered an analogous provision of the
Immigration Act
then in force."
[30]
Robertson, J.A., then added the following at page 311:
"Strictly speaking, we are not concerned with establishing the innocence or guilt of the appellant. In this respect, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and
are supportive of one another; both are ad idem that proof of a fact on a balance of probabilities is not required. However, not all exclusion clause issues can be resolved by reference to the 'less-than-civil-law' standard.
"In my opinion, the requisite standard of proof comes into legal play only when the tribunal is called on to make determinations which can be classified as questions of fact. The 'less-than-civil-law' standard is irrelevant when the issue being addressed is essentially a question of law."
[31]
Finally, he stated the following at page 313:
"In my view, the standard of proof envisaged by the exclusion clause was intended to serve an evidential function in circumstances where it is necessary to weigh competing evidence. It must not be permitted to overstep its legislated objective. In the present context, the standard of proof becomes relevant only in respect of the following questions of fact.
"It is a question of fact whether the appellant or members of his platoon killed civilians. The standard of proof to be applied is that embodied in the term 'serious reasons for considering'. Similarly, it is a question of fact whether the appellant stood guard during the torture of a prisoner. As that fact is admitted, the requisite standard of proof has been satisfied. That standard, however, has no bearing on the following determinations.
"It is a question of law whether the act of killing civilians by military personnel can be classified as a crime against humanity. It must be accepted that such acts satisfy the legal critiera found within the
and the
Convention
. It is also a question of law whether the appellant's acts or omissions as a guard constitute a crime against humanity. That determination can only be made by reference to legal principles found in the existing jurisprudence dealing with 'complicity'. Finally, it is a question of law whether membership in a military organization, such as the Salvadoran army, constitutes sufficient complicity to warrant application of the exclusion clause.
"It seems clear that questions of law do not lend themselves to adjudication by reference to legal concepts embedded in probability theory. Yet there are other reasons for immunizing questions of law from the application of a standard of proof. It is true that the 'less-than-civil-law' standard established in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> reinforces the view that it was the intent of the
Convention
signatories to exclude persons undeserving of protection. but it is difficult to credit the intention of establishing a threshold standard of proof which virtually guarantees exclusion once the Minister demonstrates that there are 'serious reasons for considering' that a claimant's acts or omissions
be classified as a crime against humanity.
"In my opinion, that is a question of law which must be decided in accordance with legal principles rather than by reference to a standard of proof. (Those legal principles will be applied to a series of facts established pursuant to the 'less-than-civil-law' standard of proof, 'serious reasons for considering'.) To hold otherwise would be tantamount to an egregious rewriting of the exclusion clause and may well lead to unfortunate and unjust refugee determinations. For example, prisoners of war who assisted the enemy in its persecution of other prisoners could be denied protection under international law should the 'less-than-civil-law' standard be applied to what is essentially a question of law. The paradigmatic situation would involve the plight of 'kapos' (Jewish prisoners) who supervised other prisoners at the Treblinka concentration camp; see
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (1981), at pages 534-535. I take it that in such cases the 'less-than-civil-law' standard contemplated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> would be deemed inapplicable as would the exclusion clause itself."
[32]
For Robertson, J.A., the standard of proof embodied in the words "serious reasons for considering" applies uniquely to the determination of the crimes alleged against the person. As for whether a particular crime is a crime against humanity, that is a question of law and the (lower) standard of proof is inapplicable.
[33]
As a result, the determination of acts committed by the claimant in the instant case as a prison director and investigating officer is a question of fact to which "The standard of proof to be applied is that embodied in the term 'serious reasons for considering'".
[34]
According to the evidence adduced before the Board, the claimant, as director of the Deh Mazang central prison, knew that prisoners detained in his prison were being tortured. According to that same evidence, the claimant also acknowledged that some prisoners had died because of the poor living conditions in the central prison. As for the conscription of children and teenagers, it can be seen from the evidence that the claimant held the position of investigating officer for eight years. Thus, the claimant reported to the authorities in Kabul throughout that period [Translation] "on the state of recruitment of forces in the regions", including the conscription of children and teenagers. In view of that evidence, the Board found that the claimant, because he was an accomplice and contributor, should be held responsible for the ill treatment suffered by prisoners and the conscription of children and teenagers.
[35]
The question that therefore arises is whether the claimant's complicity and contribution are such that he should be held responsible for the torture of prisoners and the conscription of children and teenagers.
[36]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at page 174, my colleague Reed, J., made the following comment on the concept of complicity:
"[6] As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has the power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself) but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. I note that the situation envisaged by this jurisprudence is not one in which isolated incidents of international offenses have occurred but where the commission of such offenses is a continuous and regular part of the operation."
[37]
The following comment by MacKay, J., of this court in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at page 234, was along the same lines:
"Essentially then, three prerequisites must be established in order to provide complicity in the commission of an international offence: (1) membership in an organization which committed international offences as a continuous and regular part of its operation, (2) personal and knowing participation, and (3) failure to disassociate from the organization at the earliest safe opportunity."
[38]
The concept of complicity was also discussed by Linden, J.A., of the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.). At pages 437-442, Linden, J.A., summarized the principles to be applied to the concept of complicity in relation to section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
. The following principles can be extracted from Linden, J.A.'s, comments:
1. A person who commits a crime must be held responsible therefor.
2. A person may be responsible for a crime he or she did not personally commit, that is, as an accomplice.
3. The starting point for the existence of complicity is "personal and knowing participation" by the person in question.
4. Mere bystanders are not accomplices.
5. A person who aids in or encourages the commission of a crime may be responsible therefor.
6. A superior may be responsible for crimes committed by those under his or her command if the superior knew about them.
7. A person may be held responsible for crimes committed by others because of his or her close association with those who committed them.
8. The more important the position held by a person in an organization that has committed one or more crimes, the more likely his or her complicity.
9. A person who continues to hold a leadership position in such an organization with full knowledge that the organization is responsible for crimes may be considered an accomplice.
10. Evidence that the individual protested against the crime, tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization must be taken into consideration in determining he or she is responsible.
[39]
At page 442 of his judgment in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Linden, J.A., concluded his discussion on a person's complicity by reason of association with those who commit crimes as follows:
"To sum up, association with a person or organization responsible for international crimes may constitute complicity if there is personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes. Mere membership in a group responsible for international crimes, unless it is an organization that has a 'limited, brutal purpose', is not enough ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at page 317). Moreover, the closer one is to a position of leadership or command within an organization, the easier it will be to draw an inference of awareness of the crimes and participation in the plan to commit the crimes."
[40]
In light of these authorities, it is my view that the Board did not err in finding that the claimant is responsible where the detention of prisoners in the central prison and the conscription of children and teenagers are concerned.
[41]
The claimant held the position of deputy director of the central prison from 1976 to 1978. In April 1978 he was appointed director of the central prison by the new regime, which included colleagues and friends of his. He admitted that political prisoners in the central prison had been tortured. He also admitted that the lives of the prisoners were endangered by poor living conditions in the prison. The claimant even admitted that some prisoners had died because of those poor living conditions. There is in my view no question that the claimant, as deputy director and director of the central prison, had or should have had full knowledge of the crimes committed against prisoners in the central prison. There is no evidence that the claimant tried to protest against those crimes or to withdraw from his position. As I have already mentioned, the claimant had colleagues and friends in important positions in the Parcham faction of the communist party. Indeed, the claimant testified that some of them "had become high ranking people in [
] Ministry of Interior Affairs, and due to their friendship I became the prison director".
[42]
In view of this evidence, the Board's conclusion that the claimant should be held responsible for the ill treatment suffered by prisoners in the central prison is not at all unreasonable. On the contrary, this conclusion is supported by the evidence in the record.
[43]
Where the claimant's position as an investigating officer is concerned, it can be seen from the evidence that he held it for eight years. According to the claimant, his duties in that position consisted in acting as a liaison between Kabul and the various regions of Afghanistan and more specifically in keeping the Kabul police authorities up to date on the recruitment of forces in the regions which were to be used to fight the mujahedeen. The claimant explained that the recruitment consisted,
, in the conscription [Translation] "of children even under age 14 who were sent to fight the mujahedeen ..."
[44]
Once again, I note that the claimant held this position for eight years and at no time tried to dissociate himself from the acts committed by the regime he had to serve.
[45]
In light of the evidence, it is clear that the claimant held a number of important positions during the period in which the communist regime held power in Afghanistan with Russian support. It is also clear that the claimant had a number of friends and colleagues in important positions in the communist government. It is also in my view clear that the claimant co-operated fully with the regime in power. Finally, it is also clear that the claimant never seriously attempted to resign his positions as deputy director and director of the central prison or as investigating officer. On this point, as I mentioned above, the Board found that the claimant lacked credibility and stated that he had tried [Translation] "to minimize his various roles in order to reduce his moral responsibility".
[46]
I therefore find that the evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the claimant was an accomplice in and contributor to the torture of prisoners and the conscription of children and teenagers.
[47]
The next question is whether the acts and omissions alleged against the claimant by the Board constituted crimes against humanity or acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
[48]
Did the acts alleged against the claimant by the Board constitute crimes against humanity?
[49]
Paragraph 150 of the
deals with the question as follows:
"In mentioning ... crimes against humanity, the
Convention
refers generally to 'international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes'. There are a considerable number of such instruments dating from the end of the Second World War up to the present time. All of them contain definitions of what constitute '... crimes against humanity'. The most comprehensive definition will be found in the 1945 London Agreement and Charter of the International Military Tribunal."
[50]
According to Article 6 of the
Charter
of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal, "murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population" are crimes against humanity.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 403, at page 408, the Federal Court of Appeal adopted the text of Article 6 of the
Charter
of the International Military Tribunal in its analysis of the concept of "crimes against humanity".
[51]
It is also of interest on this point to refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  O.A.C. 241, in which Cory, J., stated the following at pages 817-818:
"The trial judge ... explained to the jury that one of the ways that the domestic offences of kidnapping, confinement, and robbery could achieve the level of a crime against humanity was if the acts could be considered to be inhumane.
"In my view, this is an appropriate characterization which emphasizes that for example robbery, without the additional component of barbarous cruelty is not a crim against humanity."
[52]
As for "acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations", Professor Guy S. Goodwin-Gill stated the following in his book
The Refugee in International Law
(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), at pages 63-64:
"The purposes and principles of the United Nations are proclaimed in Articles 1 and 2 of the
Charter [of the United Nations]
, but they offer little clarification of the type of acts which would deprive a person of the benefits of refugee status. The principal interests are the maintenance of international peace and security, respect for the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, international co-operation in economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian matters, and the promotion of human rights for all without distinction. ...
"The general principle of respect for human rights has been developed specifically through the Universal Declaration and the 1966 Covenants, so that an individual who has denied or restricted the human rights of others may thus be argued to fall within the exception."
[53]
(Paris: Économica, 1988), at page 107, the French jurist Frédéric Tiberghien stated the following:
[Translation] "There is ... no question that the promotion of and effective respect for human rights is one of the purposes and principles of the United Nations and one of the principal aspects of UN activities."
[54]
Thus, as I mentioned above, the question is whether the claimant's acts and omissions, as determined by the Board, constituted crimes against humanity or acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In my view, this question must be answered in the affirmative.
[55]
For these reasons, the claimant's application for judicial review must be dismissed. At the hearing, counsel for the claimant asked me to certify a question, namely whether the application of paragraph (c) of section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
should be limited to persons holding positions of importance in the government in power. In view of my reasons for finding that the application for judicial review must be dismissed, I am not prepared to certify that this case involves a serious question of general importance.
Application dismissed.
