: On July 15, 1993, I issued an order staying the applicant's ("Garcia") removal from Canada, which had been scheduled for July 17. The stay was ordered pending disposition of Garcia's July 7 application for leave and for judicial review of the June 22, 1993 decision of an immigration officer denying him an exemption, on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, from the visa requirements of s. 9(1) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended (the "
"), as provided under s. 114(2) of that
These are my brief reasons for granting the stay, written and to be filed in compliance with s. 51 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended.

Garcia arrived in Canada from Nicaragua in 1987, having been active for some years in the anti-Sandanista contra movement. He claimed Convention refugee status at that time. In October 1991, his claim was found to lack a credible basis. Judicial review of that decision was denied in March 1993.
[4]
In June 1993, Garcia applied for a visa exemption, under s. 114(2), that is, on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. It was a fairly detailed application. It contained documentary evidence, which had not been advanced in support of his refugee claim, concerning the extra-judicial treatment, including executions of contra members returned to Nicaragua. Garcia also submitted psychiatric evidence of his fragile psychological condition, for which he had been under treatment since 1988, extending to serious suicidal intentions if faced with deportation to Nicaragua. Finally, Garcia provided documentation relating to school and employment records as evidence that he had established himself in Canada.
[5]
Garcia called the immigration office on June 22, 1993, and learned that his application had been denied. He had not been called for an interview. He asked to know the reasons for the refusal, but was told he had no right to written reasons, and was provided with no reasons of any kind. Two days later, on June 24, Garcia received a letter signed by the Manager of the Ottawa Hearings, which confirmed the denial, while giving no reasons for it. On June 30, he received a Direction to Report July 17 for removal to Managua.
[6]
The question of the court's jurisdiction to dispose of the present motion for a stay of removal was not contested before me. I note, as have my colleagues before me, that the jurisprudence of this court remains divided on the question. (See, for example,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).)
[7]
The basis on which the present motion must be determined is the well-known <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> standard ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.)), which requires Garcia to establish that there is a serious issue to be tried, that irreparable harm would fall to the applicant should the stay not be granted, and that the balance of convenience favours him rather than the public interest.
[8]
In deciding to grant the stay, I was mindful of the concern previously expressed by members of this court that stays, if granted too readily, may become open to abuse as unjustified tactics to delay removal from  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).) However, this concern must be balanced against the principle that each case should be determined on its own merits. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).) In the instant case, the stay sought appeared to me to have a solid basis, and I was satisfied Garcia had met all three <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> requirements.
[9]
On the question of irreparable harm, there was no doubt in my mind that owing to Garcia's precarious state of mind, removal from Canada at this time could indeed result in real and irreversible harm to him. There is, as a result, equally no doubt that the balance of convenience favours Garcia: the only inconvenience to the respondent in this matter is that of minimal delay in removing Garcia from Canada, should his application for leave and for judicial review not be granted.
[10]
The consideration which was the most difficult to assess, in light of the fact that the application for leave remains to be decided, was whether Garcia had raised a serious issue to be tried. As has been noted by Reed, J., the difficulty in such cases is that "one of the main issues to be decided in considering whether to grant a stay is the same or at least similar to that which must be decided in determining whether to grant leave: whether a serious question to be tried exists" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).
[11]
However, while not purporting to prejudge the issues raised in the pending application for leave, I am of the view that at this stage Garcia has raised a serious issue of procedural fairness in the treatment of his application for humanitarian and compassionate consideration.
[12]
A review of the jurisprudence of this court reveals that the scope of the duty of fairness owed by immigration officers making administrative decisions under the
varies depending on the circumstances of each case ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 400, at p. 405 (F.C.T.D.).) The obligation to observe procedural fairness has been extended, for example, to providing applicants an opportunity to respond to administrative concerns about their applications prior to the decision on, and disposition of, those applications ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 105 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.).) I note that this question has been found to constitute a serious issue in the context of a stay application (See
, supra), as has the failure to give any sort of reasons for a denial of humanitarian and compassionate exemption ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)). In the majority of the above cases, the applicant had undergone an interview with immigration officials concerning the application under consideration ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> is the exception). In at least one other instance, this court has found that failure to grant an interview on a humanitarian and compassionate application "did not represent the full and fair consideration to which applicant is entitled under the guidelines" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)).
[13]
Consequently, although I make no judgment on the merits to be determined in the application for leave, these authorities support my view that Garcia has raised a serious issue of fairness.
[14]
For these reasons, I ordered that the execution of the removal order be stayed until such time as Garcia's application for leave and for judicial review has been resolved.
Motion granted.
