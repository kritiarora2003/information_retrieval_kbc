Strayer, J.
: These are two appeals from decisions of November 29, 1985, by the Chairman of an Opposition Board refusing the appellant's trademark applications SN470,139 and SN470,140 for the trademarks NUTRI-BRAN and NUTRI-VITE respectively. These were applications for a proposed use in Canada of these trademarks in association with "cereal and vegetable-derived food products to be used as a breakfast food and snack food".
[2]
The respondent Maximum Nutrition Limited is the registered owner of the trademarks NUTRI-MAX, number 191,066 registered May 18, 1973; and NUTRI-FIBRE, number 252,722 registered November 14, 1980. It filed a notice of opposition with respect to the applicant's applications. While the notices of opposition set out several grounds, it is agreed that the essential issue raised before the Registrar and in these appeals is that of possible confusion between the respondent's registered trademarks and the proposed trademarks of the appellant.
[3]
The Chairman of the Opposition Board on behalf of the Registrar, in decisions dated November 29, 1985, decided in favour of the respondent with respect to possible confusion with its trademark NUTRI-MAX and refused registration of the appellant's proposed trademarks. These are appeals from those decisions. They were argued together and it was agreed that, for the purposes of costs, they should be treated as one appeal.
[4]
On the appeals the applicant filed some new affidavits, principally to overcome shortcomings which the Chairman had found in the material filed before him.
[5]
Before proceeding to my conclusions I wish to refer to some principles which have guided me in dealing with this matter. First, the appellant urged me to treat the matter as completely de novo without regard to the Chairman's decisions. While I accept that these appeals involve determinations of fact which I am as entitled as a Registrar to make, in my view the court should be reluctant to reverse the finding of the Registrar or Chairman unless it is clearly satisfied that he came to the wrong conclusion on the facts or unless there is significant new evidence placed before the court that was not before the Registrar. Secondly, the onus is on an applicant for registration of a trademark to satisfy the Registrar, or on appeal the court, that there is little likelihood of confusion between his proposed trademark and the registered trademark of a party filing an opposition. Thirdly, it should be kept in mind that this is not an action for infringement of the respondent's registered trademarks nor is it an action for the expungement from the register of the respondent's trademarks: that is, the validity of the respondent's trademarks are not in issue and there is no onus on the respondent to demonstrate that its trademarks are not confusing with the trademarks of third parties not before this court.
[6]
Proceeding on these principles, I am not persuaded that the appellant has met the onus on it to show that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between its proposed trademarks and the registered trademark NUTRI-MAX of the respondent. I am satisfied that the state of the evidence placed before Chairman was such as to justify amply the decisions he reached, and the new materials put before me do not significantly alter the nature of the evidence available.
[7]
It was common ground that the essential tests for confusion in this respect are found in s. 6(5) of the Trade Marks Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10. Looking first at the circumstances specifically mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (e) of that subsection, with respect to the criterion of "inherent distinctiveness" set out in paragraph (a) I would agree with the contention of the appellant and the finding of the Chairman that the respondent's marks have very limited inherent distinctiveness. The word "NUTRI" suggests something nutritious and combined with the words "BRAN" or "MAX" is not very inventive as a name for a food product. With respect to paragraph (b), which requires me to consider "the length of time the trademarks ... have been in use", there was ample evidence before the Chairman and before me as to the use of the respondent's trademark NUTRI-MAX at the relevant time. This evidence demonstrated such use during the five years preceding November, 1982. Whether one takes the relevant date for testing use to be the date of the applicant's applications, that is May 19, 1981, or the date of the oppositions which, as amended, were filed on or about December 17, 1981, there is ample evidence of use by the respondent of this trademark. There was no evidence of use by the applicant of its trademarks at either of those dates. With respect to paragraph (c), "the nature of the wares ...", the Chairman found, and I agree, that there is a similarity between the products of the parties. The respondent's trademarks were registered in respect of "health foods" and a long list of such foods was included by way of definition of this term. The applicant seeks to register its proposed trademarks in respect of "breakfast food and snack food" derived from cereals and vegetables. There is clearly a large potential area of overlap and the appellant has failed to demonstrate the contrary. It was certainly open to the Chairman to find, as he did, and I agree, that with respect to paragraph (d) the nature of the trade in the appellant's products and the respondent's products could be similar. Again, the appellant while in argument suggested the possibility that its products might be sold in grocery stores whereas the respondent's would be sold in health food stores, or that their respective products might be sold in different sections of the same supermarkets, no evidence on this point was brought to my attention and I am prepared to conclude, as did the Chairman, that the fact that the kinds of products covered by the respective trademarks overlap would most probably lead to them being sold in similar channels of trade to some extent. With respect to paragraph (e), "the degree of resemblance between the trademarks ... in appearance or sound", I find that there is at least some resemblance. The use of the word "NUTRI" in all of them provides a resemblance in sight and sound and the ideas which they convey are similar when used in connection with the kinds of food contemplated.
[8]
It is not of course necessary for the Registrar to find that all of the circumstances specifically listed in subsection 6(5) exist, or exist to an equal degree, to be satisfied that the trademarks in question would be confusing. Looking only at the circumstances listed in paragraphs (a) to (e), I am satisfied that in relation to the evidence before the Chairman and before me it is proper to find the likelihood of confusion between the appellant's proposed trademarks and NUTRI-MAX.
[9]
The appellant argues, however, that one must look at the opening words of s. 6(5) which direct the court or the Registrar to have regard "to all the surrounding circumstances" including those specifically listed. The appellant contends that there is compelling evidence of another circumstance, a lack of distinctiveness of the respondent's registered trademarks in relation to the trademarks and trade names of third parties, which should have led the Registrar or should lead the court to conclude that there is no likelihood of confusion between the appellant's proposed trademarks and the respondent's registered trademarks. The appellant sought to demonstrate through evidence submitted to the Chairman that the word "NUTRI" is in such common use in other trademarks, trade names and company names that it is in no way distinctive. Most of this evidence was held to be defective by the Chairman. New affidavits were filed before me to overcome those defects. Counsel for the appellant states, and this was not refuted by counsel for the respondent, that according to the evidence now on file as of the filing date of the applicant's applications, May 19, 1981, there were at least forty-seven trademark registrations and forty-three trade names using the word "NUTRI". As of the opposition date, December 17, 1981, there were at least a further three trade names. Since that time there have been eighteen further trademark registrations or applications therefor and sixty-six trade names adopted using this word. I am not satisfied that such a "surrounding circumstance" adds much to the appellant's case. It may well be, in fact, that this is more relevant to the question of "inherent distinctiveness", which the Chairman and I have both already found the respondent's trademarks to lack. Further, I reiterate that the trademarks of the respondent are in no way on trial here. Nor is the respondent suing the applicant for infringement of the former's registered trademarks. What the Chairman had to decide on behalf of the Registrar, and what I have to decide, is whether the appellant has demonstrated that there is no likelihood of confusion between its proposed trademarks and the proposed trademarks of the respondent referred to in its opposition. Having regard to the nature of the products and of these particular trademarks I do not think the appellant has met the onus on it at least with respect to possible confusion with NUTRI-MAX. The fact that there are many other trademarks, trade names and businesses which use the word "NUTRI" is only marginally relevant to the issues which must be decided in these proceedings. The appellant relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This was an action brought by the Coca-Cola Company for infringement, and the defendant Pepsi-Cola Company counterclaimed to have the plaintiff's trademark expunged. At page 33 the court held admissible, and took into account, the fact that there were some thirty other trademarks and trade names registered in Canada in which the word "Cola" was used. This evidence was held to be "admissible as some evidence of the general adoption of the word in names for different beverages or tonics ...". The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on appeal, [1942] 1 C.P.R. 293 at 299 approved the admission of this evidence "as showing that the word Cola ... had been adopted in Canada as an item in the naming of different beverages. The proper comparison must be made with that fact in mind. ..." It must be remembered that this was an action for infringement. The Supreme Court noted at page 32 of its judgment:
"The authorities are plain, we think, that the rules of comparison for testing an alleged infringement of a registered mark resemble those rules by which the question of similarity on an application for registration is tested but that it is necessary to establish a closer likeness in order to make out an actual infringement than would justify the refusal of an application to register. The burden on a plaintiff in an infringement action is to show reasonable probability of confusion, while an applicant for registration must establish, if challenged, the absence of all reasonable prospect of confusion."
This distinguishes the Pepsi-Cola case from the present applications for registration. It should also be noted that the question of whether the word "Cola" had been adopted in Canada as an item in the naming of different beverages was relevant to a finding in effect that "Cola" is a generic description for a certain kind of beverage so that the plaintiff, the Coca-Cola Company, had to demonstrate that the word "Coca" was infringed by the defendant's word  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . Such a finding is not possible, on the evidence, in the present case in connection with the word "NUTRI".

The appellant having failed to meet the onus upon it, the appeals are dismissed. Costs are awarded to the respondent on the basis that the two matters will be treated as one appeal.
