Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, being Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, Schedule B to the Canada Act, 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c.11 (the
Charter

Background Facts
[2]
The underlying proceeding is an application for judicial review of Order-in-Council 2005-1289 dated June 28, 2005 which set aside the November 8, 2004 election of all nine councillors of the Gull Bay First Nation Band (the Band) pursuant to section 79 of the
, on the ground that three councillors were ineligible for candidacy under subsection 75(1) because they did not reside on the reserve at the time of nomination. The applicants are eight of the nine Band councillors duly elected subject to the provisions of the
and the
Indian Band Election Regulations
Election Regulations
).
The Election Appeal
[3]
After the election, three Band members filed "election appeals" pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(c) of the
Election Regulations
, alleging that seven successful candidates were ineligible to hold office because they were not resident on the reserve within the meaning of subsection 75(1) of the
. Pursuant to section 13 of the
Election Regulations
, on February 25, 2005 the Director of Band Governance at Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada (IAND) retained an independent third party to investigate the residency status of the challenged councillors. By report dated April 26, 2005 the investigator concluded that three of the Applicants, Rita King, Gwendoline King, and Brian King, were not residents on the reserve at the time of nomination. In accordance with paragraph 14(c) of the
Election Regulations
, the Minister recommended that the Governor-in-Council set aside the election.
The Decision under Review
[4]
On June 28, 2005, by Order-in-Council 2005-1289, the Governor-in-Council set aside the election of all nine Gull Bay First Nation Band councillors. On July 28, 2005, the applicants commenced this application for judicial review in respect of this decision. The notice of application sought relief, inter alia, in the nature of a declaration under section 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
that section 75 of the
is invalid to the extent that it conflicts with section 15 of the
Charter
. On January 4, 2006 the applicants filed and served a notice of constitutional question on the Attorney General of Canada and all provincial Attorneys General, in accordance with section 57 of the
Federal Courts Act
.
Interlocutory Injunction
[5]
On August 10, 2005 Mr. Justice François Lemieux of this Court granted the applicants an interlocutory injunction pending final determination of the application for judicial review, prohibiting the Gull Bay First Nation by-election scheduled for August 12, 2005 from proceeding and reinstating all nine Band councillors duly elected on November 8, 2004.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
Urgency
[6]
The applicants were elected to hold office for two years, and the next election for Gull Bay First Nation Chief and Council is scheduled to be held in November 2006. The election of the next Gull Bay Band Council will render moot this application for judicial review if it is not decided by that time. Recognizing the need to expedite the hearing of the application prior to it becoming moot, Justice Lemieux ordered that the hearing be expedited and granted a scheduling order agreed to by the parties on September 6, 2005. As required, the applicants served and filed their affidavits on October 5, 2005, within 30 days of the scheduling order. The respondent failed to file its affidavit material within the requisite ensuing 30-day period. Instead, on November 4, 2005, the respondent filed a "draft" notice of motion. The respondent filed this Notice of Motion on December 12, 2005.
The legislation relevant to this motion is:
1.
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I to the
Constitution Act, 1982
, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11;
2.
Indian Band Election Regulations
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7; and
5.
Federal Courts Rules
The relevant excerpts of the legislation are set out in Appendix "A".
The issues are:
1. are the respondent's requests for relief res judicata or an abuse of the Court's process?;
2. should the Court grant an order striking the applicants' requests for declaratory relief under section 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
with respect to section 75 of the
and section 15 of the
Charter
?;
3. in the alternative, should the Court grant an order directing that those portions of the Notice of Application relating to section 15 of the
Charter
be treated and proceeded with as an action?;
4. should the Court grant an order amending the Order of this Court dated September 6, 2005 to extend the time for serving and filing the respondent's affidavits and documentary exhibits?; and
5. should the Court grant an order treating as confidential the Investigation Report of Larry Dyck and the Recommendation Report of Christine Aubin?
: Are the respondent's requests for relief res judicata or an abuse of the Court's process?
[9]
The applicants submit that the respondent's requests on this motion to strike out a portion of the application, or alternatively for an extension of time to file its affidavit material, or converting the
Charter
argument to an action are each res judicata by reason of having already been decided by Mr. Justice Lemieux in Orders dated August 10, 2005 and September 6, 2005. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) The applicants argue that each of these three requests are an abuse of the Court's process.
[10]
In the applicants' view, the Orders of Justice Lemieux decided that they had a strong prima facie case which should proceed on judicial review and not by action, and that the respondent should not be granted an extension to file its affidavit materials. Justice Lemieux, in his Order dated August 10, 2005 in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  case that Order-in-Council 2005-1289 was invalid, but expressly did not decide the strength of the
Charter
"¶ 23 In my view Counsel for
the Applicants has made out a strong prima facie case that the Order-in-Council is invalid on the grounds advanced before this Court
.
[. . . . .]
"¶ 28 I am also of the view the matters of statutory interpretation raised by Counsel for the Respondent raise strong prima facie questions whether under section 97(c) of the
the Govern-in-Council [sic] can set aside the election of eligible candidates and whether the concept of 'residence' was properly applied.
I make no comment on the strength of the
Charter
issue as this point was not pressed before me
." (Emphasis added.)
The sufficiency of the
Charter
argument has not been decided and is not res judicata. It is open to the Respondent to bring its motion to strike out the
Charter
argument from the notice of application if it believes it is bereft of any possibility of success.
[11]
The respondent may also bring its motion under rule 8 of the
Federal Courts Rules
seeking an extension of time to file its affidavit materials. Justice Lemieux's scheduling order dated September 6, 2005 does not disentitle a party to apply to the Court for an extension or abridgement of time where there is a genuine basis to do so. I reject the submission that
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) is authority that the respondent could only seek an extension of time by appealing the Court's scheduling order dated September 6, 2005.
[12]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  proceed as an action.
[13]
Accordingly, the relief sought by the respondent on its motion have not been previously decided and are not res judicata. Neither are they an abuse of the Court's process by reason of being res judicata.
: Should the Court grant an order striking the applicants' requests for declaratory relief under section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 with respect to section 75 of the Indian Act and section 15 of the Charter?
[14]
As grounds for its motion to strike, the respondent cites that the applicants' request for relief under section 15 of the
Charter
are: an abuse of process; scandalous, frivolous and vexatious; and clearly improper so as to be bereft of any possibility of success. Specifically:
(a) the applicants do not have standing to seek declaratory relief under the
Charter
;
(b) the applicants have not adduced a sufficient evidentiary basis in support of the
Charter
(c) the declaratory relief under the
Charter
cannot offer the remedy sought.
[15]
There is no provision in the
Federal Courts Rules
granting this Court jurisdiction to strike out a Notice of Application or portions thereof.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.) the Federal Court of Appeal held per Justice Strayer at paragraph 15 that the Court retains an inherent jurisdiction to "dismiss in summary manner a notice of motion which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success."
(a) Standing
[16]
The respondent submits that the applicants do not have standing to argue that section 75 of the
discriminates against them because each of the applicants have filed an affidavit that they were resident on the reserve at the material time. The respondent's position is inconsistent with the Order-in-Council which set aside the election because three of the applicants were found by the respondent to be not resident on the reserve at the material time. For this reason, the applicants clearly have standing to argue discrimination.
(b) Sufficient evidence in the Charter context
[17]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Man.R.(2d) 270, Mr. Justice Cory held that
Charter
decisions must not be made in a factual vacuum, that an insufficient factual basis may be fatal to requests for relief, and that in appropriate circumstances judicial notice could overcome the insufficiency of evidence before the Court. Justice Cory held at paragraphs 9, 19, and 20:
"¶ 9
Charter
decisions should not and must not be made in a factual vacuum. To attempt to do so would trivialize the
Charter
and inevitably result in ill-considered opinions. [...]
[. . . . .]
"¶ 19 [...] It may well be that one could take judicial notice of some of the broad social facts referred to by the appellants, but here there is a total absence of a factual foundation to support their case.
"¶ 20 A factual foundation is of fundamental importance on this appeal. It is not the purpose of the legislation which is said to infringe the
Charter
but its effects. If the deleterious effects are not established there can be no
Charter
violation and no case has been made out. Thus the absence of a factual base is not just a technicality that could be overlooked, but rather it is a flaw that is fatal to the appellants' position."
[18]
I have already concluded that there is some evidence upon which the Applications Judge could find the applicants have standing to seek declaratory relief. I therefore turn to determine whether the applicants have tendered a sufficient evidentiary basis to possibly substantiate the three branches of the test articulated by Mr. Justice Iacobucci in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , and so establish an infringement of the applicants' section 15
Charter
right.
[19]
, Justice Iacobucci held at paragraph 88 that the Court must decide whether an impugned law imposes differential treatment between the claimant and others on an enumerated or analogous ground, and which has a discriminatory purpose or effect within the meaning of the equality guarantee:
"¶ 88 [...]
"(2) The approach adopted and regularly applied by this Court to the interpretation of s. 15(1) focuses upon three central issues:
(A) whether a law imposes differential treatment between the claimant and others, in purpose or effect;
(B) whether one or more enumerated or analogous grounds of discrimination are the basis for the differential treatment; and
(C) whether the law in question has a purpose or effect that is discriminatory within the meaning of the equality guarantee."
[20]
At the hearing of this motion, the respondent agreed that the applicants were subject to differential treatment on the analogous ground of "Aboriginality-residency". The respondent agrees with the applicant that the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  is authority for the proposition that Aboriginality-residency is an analogous ground to the enumerated grounds of discrimination set out in subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
. Speaking for the majority of the Court, Justices McLachlin and Bastarache held at paragraph 10 that Aboriginality-residency will always be an analogous ground for an inquiry of the Court under section 15 of the
Charter
:
"¶ 10 If it is the intention of L'Heureux-Dubé, J.'s, reasons to affirm contextual dependency of the enumerated and analogous grounds, we must respectfully disagree.
If 'Aboriginality-residence' is to be an analogous ground (and we agree with L'Heureux-Dubé, J., that it should), then it must always stand as a constant marker of potential legislative discrimination, whether the challenge is to a governmental tax credit, a voting right, or a pension scheme
. This established, the analysis moves to the third stage: whether the distinction amounts, in purpose or effect, to discrimination on the facts of the case." (Emphasis added.)
[21]
In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> the Court held that subsection 77(1) of the
provides the basis for governmental decisions on the ground of Aboriginality-residency. Section 75 of the
also contains a residency requirement and provides grounds for governmental action under section 79. Since the decision under review in this case is an Order-in-Council grounded in a finding of ineligible candidacy for nomination according to section 75, it would be open to the Applications Judge to find it is a decision based on the analogous ground of Aboriginality-residency.
[22]
The third part of the test under
"... whether the law in question has a purpose or effect that is discriminatory within the meaning of the equality guarantee."
[23]
Whether the distinction drawn between the off-reserve applicants and on-reserve Band members is discriminatory, the Applications Judge will have regard to, inter alia, the contextual factors articulated by Mr. Justice Iacobucci in
Pre-existing disadvantage, stereotyping, prejudice, or vulnerability experienced by the individual or group at issue
. The effects of a law as they relate to the important purpose of s. 15(1) in protecting individuals or groups who are vulnerable, disadvantaged, or members of 'discrete and insular minorities' should always be a central consideration. Although the claimant's association with a historically more advantaged or disadvantaged group or groups is not per se determinative of an infringement, the existence of these pre-existing factors will favour a finding that s. 15(1) has been infringed.
The correspondence, or lack thereof, between the ground or grounds on which the claim is based and the actual need, capacity, or circumstances of the claimant or others
. Although the mere fact that the impugned legislation takes into account the claimant's traits or circumstances will not necessarily be sufficient to defeat a s. 15(1) claim, it will generally be more difficult to establish discrimination to the extent that the law takes into account the claimant's actual situation in a manner that respects his or her value as a human being or member of Canadian society, and less difficult to do so where the law fails to take into account the claimant's actual situation.
The ameliorative purpose or effects of the impugned law upon a more disadvantaged person or group in society
. An ameliorative purpose or effect which accords with the purpose of s. 15(1) of the
Charter
will likely not violate the human dignity of more advantaged individuals where the exclusion of these more advantaged individuals largely corresponds to the greater need or the different circumstances experienced by the disadvantaged group being targeted by the legislation. This factor is more relevant where the s. 15(1) claim is brought by a more advantaged member of society.
and
The nature and scope of the interest affected by the impugned law
. The more severe and localized the consequences of the legislation for the affected group, the more likely that the differential treatment responsible for these consequences is discriminatory within the meaning of s. 15(1)." (Emphasis added.)
[24]
I cannot conclude that the applicants have filed no evidence relevant to the potentially discriminatory effect of the impugned legislation. The applicants have filed the following affidavits in this case:
(a) 11 affidavits filed on August 3, 2005 in support of their successful motion for interim relief before Justice Lemieux on August 8, 2005;
(b) 21 affidavits filed on October 5, 2005 in support of their notice of application for judicial review; and
(c) 1 affidavit filed on November 30, 2005 sworn by Chief Wilfred King in support of their motion on December 5, 2005 before Prothonotary Milczynski which set down the date for the motion presently before this Court.
[25]
The affidavit evidence from the applicants state that many homes on the Gull River Reserve Number 55 have been deemed uninhabitable and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs provides rooms for Band members at the Ramada Inn and the Prince Arthur Hotel in Thunder Bay. The houses are uninhabitable due to a variety of problems including mould, lack of running water, lack of power and inadequate sewers. The dissatisfaction on the reserve has manifested itself in repeated fires, break-ins and vandalism to the band office and the police station. The Affidavit of Franco Crupi sworn July 28, 2005 states that there are approximately 400 members of the Gull Bay First Nation who live on the reserve in approximately 83 houses, many of which have mould contamination or are substandard and are potentially uninhabitable. Approximately 40 residents of the reserve are currently living in the Ramada Inn and the Prince Arthur Hotel due to serious mould contamination in the houses. The hotel costs are approximately $80,000 to $100,000 per month.
[26]
The housing deficiency on the reserve is allegedly of central importance to the applicants. The effect of the impugned legislation, in setting aside the applicants' election, allegedly prevents off-reserve Band members elected to Council from addressing the housing shortage which may be a reason why so many Band members live off reserve in the first place. If off-reserve members cannot participate in Band governance by holding office as councillors, they may be prevented from ameliorating the housing shortage in which they have a vested interest.
[27]
The applicants' affidavits address the nature and scope of the affected interest, being the denial to participate in band governance. For example, the affidavit sworn on July 29, 2005 by Eugene Esquega states at paragraphs 11-12, 15, and 19 that important services to the Band membership have been impaired or withheld as a result of Order-in-Council 2005-1289:
"11. When on Gull Bay First Nation Council, I work on the Task Force as the Director of Housing and Infrastructure, along with Edmond King, who spent many years working for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation ('CMHC').
"12. I have been working on all of the paperwork and negotiations necessary to bring new homes into the Gull River Reserve No. 55 community for two and a half years, and nothing has been achieved yet due to election appeals and difficulties with INAC and third party managers.
[. . . . .]
"15. The current Gull Bay First Nation housing list establishes the need for approximately ninety (90) homes to alleviate the vast overcrowding in current reserve homes, to bring the approximately forty (40) on-reserve community members who currently reside at the Ramada Inn and Prince Arthur Hotel in Thunder Bay home and to accommodate off-reserve members who wish to return to the Gull River Reserve No. 55.
[. . . . .]
"19. The Chief and Council, removed by Order in Council 2005-1289, attend meetings regularly, work together cooperatively and diligently to pursue the completion of the housing, water treatment, hydro upgrade, health programs, a strategic plan for economic development, and other projects necessary to rectifying the substandard living conditions on Gull River Reserve No. 55."
[28]
Whatever the ultimate weight given to such evidence by the Applications Judge, it cannot be said at this stage that there is no actual evidence adduced by the applicants which could tend to establish discrimination.
[29]
I am also of the view that this section 15 inquiry may be an appropriate circumstance contemplated by Mr. Justice Cory in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  insufficiency of affidavit evidence. The historic disadvantage suffered by off-reserve band members denied the right to participate in band governance is well known at law, as is the importance of the affected interest. The Supreme Court of Canada addressed both of these factors in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  applicable
factors to this case -- pre-existing disadvantage, correspondence and importance of the affected interest -- we conclude that the answer to this question is yes.
The impugned distinction perpetuates the historic disadvantage experienced by off-reserve band members by denying them the right to vote and participate in their band's governance
. Off-reserve band members have important interests in band governance which the distinction denies. They are co-owners of the band's assets. The reserve, whether they live on or off it, is their and their children's land. The band council represents them as band members to the community at large, in negotiations with the government, and within Aboriginal organizations. Although there are some matters of purely local interest, which do not as directly affect the interests of off-reserve band members, the complete denial to off-reserve members of the right to vote and participate in band governance treats them as less worthy and entitled, not on the merits of their situation, but simply because they live off-reserve.
The importance of the interest affected is underlined by the findings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996), vol. 1, Looking Forward, Looking Back, at pp. 137-91. The Royal Commission writes in vol. 4, Perspectives and Realities, at p. 521
:
'
Throughout the Commission's hearings, Aboriginal people stressed the fundamental importance of retaining and enhancing their cultural identity while living in urban areas. Aboriginal identity lies at the heart of Aboriginal peoples' existence; maintaining that identity is an essential and self-validating pursuit for Aboriginal people in cities
.'
'Cultural identity for urban Aboriginal people is also tied to a land base or ancestral territory. For many, the two concepts are inseparable. ... Identification with an ancestral place is important to urban people because of the associated ritual, ceremony and traditions, as well as the people who remain there, the sense of belonging, the bond to an ancestral community, and the accessibility of family, community and elders.'" (Emphasis added.)
[30]
For these reasons, I cannot conclude that the application with respect to whether section 75 of the
"has a purpose or effect that is discriminatory within the meaning of the equality guarantee" is bereft of any possibility of success. This threshold on a motion to stike is below the balance of probabilities threshold required for the applicants to succeed at their hearing on the merits. That is a decision for the Judge hearing the application.
(c) Declaratory relief will not grant remedy sought
[31]
The respondent submits that the applicants seek to have the Order-in-Council declared invalid, which would have the effect of restoring the November 8, 2004 Gull Bay First Nation election. However, if the applicants successfully obtain a declaration that section 75 of the
is inconsistent with section 15 of the
Charter
, this would call into question the validity of
election conducted under the provisions of the
and
, including that of the Gull Bay Band.
[32]
I do not agree. The remedy granted by the Court pursuant to section 52 of the
Constitution Act
is not so clear as to render all such elections a nullity. Moreover, the nature of the remedy sought by the applicants, in this case a declaration of invalidity under section 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, is not relevant to whether the applicants' request for relief is bereft of any possibility of success. In my view, the issue of what remedy is appropriate to redress a section 15
Charter
right infringement is an issue properly within the purview of the Applications Judge deciding the merits of the judicial review. It is not appropriate for the Motions Judge at this stage to disentitle the applicants from a decision on the merits of their constitutional question by reason that they may have incompletely framed their request for remedy in their Notice of Application.
[33]
In these circumstances, I am unable to conclude that the portion of the Notice of Application seeking declaratory relief in relation to section 75 of the
falls within the exceptional circumstances referred to in
, above, such that it is "so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success." Accordingly, the Court will not grant the respondent's motion to strike.
Issue No. 3: In the alternative, should the Court grant an order directing that those portions of the Notice of Application relating to section 15 of the Charter be treated and proceeded with as an action?
[34]
As grounds for its motion to convert the applicants' request for declaratory relief under the
Charter
to an action, the respondent submits that:
(a) affidavit evidence cannot satisfactorily establish the facts relevant to an inquiry under section 15 of the
Charter
or the appropriate remedy under section 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
; and
(b) the Court's disposition may affect First Nations across Canada who conduct their Chief and council elections in accordance with the
and
Indian Band Election Regulations
.
The respondent submits that expert evidence may be required for the Court to resolve the constitutional question, and that the Court will wish to hear the witnesses to assess their credibility in the event of conflicting evidence.
[36]
The applicants rely on this Court's decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) in which Madame Justice Barbara Reed dismissed a motion to convert a judicial review to an action where the issue before the Court was a complex determination of aboriginal rights under section 35 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
. The applicants submit that where affidavit evidence is sufficient for the Court to resolve complex issues in dispute, the matter need not proceed as an action. In
Neskonlith Band
, Madame Justice Reed held at paragraph 15:
"... I am persuaded that if anyone is to suffer from any weakness in not providing more extensive evidence with respect to the Aboriginal rights in issue, it will be the applicants. If they wish to proceed on the basis of the material already filed, then, a trial proceeding should not be imposed on them."
[37]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S.(3d) 410 (F.C.), I considered the law regarding motions to convert. The general rule is that applications for judicial review be proceeded with as motions so that they can be determined "without delay and in a summary way". A motion to convert is an exception to the general rule only to be allowed in the clearest of circumstances. Secondly, a motion to convert should only be permitted where the facts cannot be satisfactorily established or weighed through affidavit evidence.
[38]
In this case, the applicants have an important need for their application to be determined "without delay and in a summary way". Moreover, in this case there is no submission that the facts cannot be satisfactorily established or weighed through affidavit evidence.
[39]
The Attorney General seeks to have the application converted to permit the Court to understand the impact on First Nations across Canada. While the Attorney General may wish to have this important issue decided in an action, the applicants are entitled to proceed by way of judicial review.
: Should the Court grant an order amending the Order of this Court dated September 6, 2005 to extend the time for serving and filing the respondent's affidavits and documentary exhibits?
[40]
By Order dated September 6, 2005, Mr. Justice Lemieux ordered that the respondent file its affidavit material within thirty days of the applicants filing their affidavits. This means that the respondent was to have filed its affidavits by November 4, 2005. Instead, the respondent filed this motion in draft. Accordingly, the respondent's affidavits have not been filed, and the respondent seeks a thirty day extension for the filing of the affidavits. The applicants agree with this extension but insist that the Court take steps to ensure that there not be any further delays. The scheduling Order of Justice Lemieux is that cross-examinations on the affidavits shall take place within twenty days of service of the respondent's affidavits. At the hearing, I put the respondent on notice that the thirty days would run from March 1, 2006 so that the affidavits for the respondent must be filed by March 30, 2006. The applicants also ask that the Court impose a timeframe within which all motions arising from the cross-examinations must take place. I think that a twenty day time limit from the date the transcript of the cross-examinations are received is a reasonable timeframe for all motions arising from the cross-examinations. This is consistent with the timeframes ordered by Justice Lemieux.
: Should the Court grant an order treating as confidential the Investigation Report of Larry Dyck and the Recommendation Report of Christine Aubin?
[41]
As grounds for its motion to treat as confidential the Investigation Report of Larry Dyck and the Recommendation Report of Christine Aubin, the respondent submits that confidentiality is necessary:
(a) to prevent the disclosure of personal information; and
(b) to preserve the confidential relationship between investigators and informants.
[42]
The applicants do not oppose the respondent's request for an order pursuant to Rule 151 of the
Federal Courts Rules
.
[43]
I am satisfied that the circumstances of this case warrant a Confidentiality Order. The parties have agreed to draft the appropriate order as to form and content for submission to the Court. The Court will issue that order with the understanding that the applicants will have access to these reports for the purpose of this litigation.
Costs
[44]
For the reasons herein, the two principal motions were without merit and have frustrated the August 10, 2005 Order of Mr. Justice Lemieux that the hearing of this judicial review application must be expedited. Justice Lemieux also ordered that counsel for the parties consult and propose to the Court a scheduling Order which was issued by Justice Lemieux on September 6, 2005. While I appreciate the reasons why the Attorney General would have preferred that this important
Charter
challenge proceed as an action, that does not add merit to these two motions.
[45]
The applicants submit that these motions are an abuse of process and an attempt by the Attorney General to delay the constitutional challenge until after the November 2006 election, which may render this application moot. I am not prepared to make such a finding. At the same time, the applicants are entitled to their legal costs payable forthwith. Justice Lemieux awarded costs to the applicants in any event of the cause on a party-and-party basis on scale at Column IV of Tariff B to the
Federal Courts Rules
. I will follow Justice Lemieux's guidance but set the legal costs at a lump sum.
[46]
In the Order of Madame Prothonotary Milczynski dated December 7, 2005 which dealt with different aspects of this motion to strike and this motion to convert, the costs were left to be determined following the hearing before myself. I am satisfied that the motion before Prothonotary Milczynski was only necessary because the Attorney General of Canada brought this motion to strike and this motion to convert. Accordingly, the costs will be awarded to the applicants before the motion before Prothonotary Milczynski on the same basis as the motions to strike and convert.
[47]
The motion for a Confidentiality Order was consented to by the applicants and there would have been no need for an oral motion before the Court. Similarly, the motion for an extension of time for the filing of the respondent's affidavits was only necessary because of the two principal motions being dismissed. Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the success on the motion before me was divided as contended by the respondent.
[48]
I will fix the counsel fee for the motions to strike and convert to an action at the lump sum of $5,000 using Scale IV as a guide, and the motion before Prothonotary Milczynski at the lump sum of $2,500.
THIS COURT ORDERS that:
1. the motion by the respondent for an order striking the requests in the Notice of Application for declaratory relief pursuant to section 15 of the
Canadian Charter
2. the motion by the respondent in the alternative for an order directing that those portions of the Notice of Application relating to section 15 of the
Canadian Charter
be converted to an action is dismissed;
