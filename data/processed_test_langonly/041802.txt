Facts
[1]
Strayer, J.
: This is an application involving four motions by the defendant: (1) that the amended statement of claim be struck out under Rule 419(1) (a) on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, and under Rule 419(1)(c) on the ground that it is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious; (2) that the amended statement of claim be struck out under Rule 419(1)(a), (d) and (f) on the ground that the named plaintiffs are not entitled to bring the action on behalf of their bands; (3) that in the alternative, certain paragraphs of the amended statement of claim be struck out as offending the rules of pleading found in Rule 408, 409 and 412; and (4) that in the further alternative, the plaintiffs be ordered to provide further and better particulars pursuant to Rule 415.
[2]
The plaintiffs consist of six Indians suing on their own behalf and on behalf of their bands (all based in Alberta) as they were constituted prior to April 17, 1985. On that date, there came into force An Act to Amend the Indian Act, S.C. 1985, c. 27 which purported to entitle certain additional persons to band membership and to change in various ways the regime relating to band membership. The plaintiffs commenced an action seeking a declaration that the amendments insofar as they are inconsistent with the guarantee of aboriginal rights found in s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 are of no force and effect. The plaintiffs, therefore, are claiming an infringement of a constitutionally-guaranteed aboriginal right of Indian bands to determine their own membership. In the alternative, the plaintiffs seek a declaration that the imposition on the bands of additional members, pursuant to the amendments to the Indian Act, without the consent of the bands is an interference with their freedom of association as guaranteed in s. 2(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[3]
The 1985 amendments change eligibility to be registered under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-6. Prior to 1985, the Indian Act, sections 5-14 set out a scheme for determining who was an Indian for the purposes of the Act. The most renowned (or notorious) of these provisions was s. 12(1)(b) which disentitled Indian women who married non-Indian men from remaining registered as Indians, and thereby also disentitled the children of such a union from Indian status. This disentitlement did not apply to Indian men who married non-Indian women and, in fact, such a marriage conferred Indian status on their non-Indian wives. This has, of course, been a point of contention and public debate for some years. Some disentitled Indian women took their case to the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  unsuccessfully claiming that this law conflicted with the Canadian Bill of Rights. When there was no remedy in that forum, one such person took her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, established under the Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Canada acceded in 1976, in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  political forum with the drafting and adoption of the Charter, with the amendment to section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 in 1983, and again upon the enactment of the 1985 amendments to the Indian Act which are in issue in this case.
[4]
It appears that with the coming into force of section 15 of the Charter on April 17, 1985, Parliament felt obliged to change s. 12(1)(b) and other provisions of the Indian Act in an effort to grant equal protection and benefit of the law to both sexes. The resulting provisions are found in the new sections 6 and 7 of the amended Indian Act. Among those thereby enabled to obtain Indian status are the following. Indian women who married non-Indian men and who had been excluded under s. 12(1)(b) or ordered enfranchised under s. 109(2) are entitled to be registered as Indians pursuant to s. 6(1)(c) upon application to the Registrar. The children of these women are also entitled upon such application. Also reinstated are children who lost Indian status at age 21 because both their mother and father's mother had gained status throught marriage to an Indian, and children who had lost status through being "protested out" upon proof that they were illegitimate offspring of an Indian woman and a non-Indian man. Non-Indian wives of Indian men are now excluded under s. 7(1)(a) as are any children of such women and non-Indian men.
[5]
The Registrar is empowered by s. 11 of the amended Act to grant membership in a band (through inclusion in a Band List) to persons who are newly entitled to be registered as Indians under s. 6 and who were, or their parents were, a member of that Band at the time of loss of Indian status.
[6]
An Indian band is entitled to assume control of its own membership under s. 10 by the establishment of membership rules. It may not however exclude members reinstated under the new s. 6 for the reasons that they were reinstated. There persons will therefore become permanent members of the band unless they infringe some other band rule in the future.
[7]
The amendments entitle certain other persons to reinstatement on June 28, 1987, if the band either does not assume control of its own membership before then or does assume such control but consents to admit these people to membership. Persons who were voluntarily enfranchised pursuant to an order made under s. 109(1) and were therefore excluded under s. 12(1)(a)(iii) will be eligible. Persons who lost status because before 1951 they resided outside Canada for more than five years without consent of the Superintendant General will be entitled to reinstatement as will persons who lost status before 1920 because they received a university degree or entered into a profession. The children of the above are also entitled, provided that they are not excluded by s. 7, as their parents may be deemed registered posthumously.
[8]
In motion (1) the applicant, in effect the Government of Canada, claims that there is no cause of action disclosed by the statement of claim or that it is frivolous, vexatious, etc. It has admitted, for the purposes of this motion only, that an aboriginal right to determine membership did exist in the bands prior to 1868. However, it claims that such right was extinguished either by the Indian Act of 1868 (which had eligibility provisions for status similar to the later Act as it stood prior to the 1985 amendment), or by treaties subsequent to 1868. It contends that if such aboriginal right was extinguished as a matter of law prior to 1982, there is no cause of action under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Similarly, it argues that there is no cause of action under s. 2(d) of the Charter as Parliament has, since 1868, determined band membership and therefore bands are not consensual "associations". A change in the requirements for status therefore cannot infringe upon any freedom of association. It is argued that if freedom of association of band majorities is involved, this cannot be protected to the prejudice of the freedom of individuals to join the band. Further, it is argued that the freedom protected by s. 2(d) must be qualified by the provisions of other sections of the Charter such as sections 1, 15, 25, 27, and 28. The remaining contentions of the Crown with respect to the other motions are more technical and can best be addressed along with my conclusions.
Conclusions
[9]
Motion (1)
- I should first discuss the nature of a motion to strike a statement of claim. The principles applicable to such a motion are clearly stated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 740 S.C.R.:
"... all the facts pleaded in the statement of claim must be deemed to have been proven. On a motion such as this a court should, of course, dismiss the action or strike out any claim made by the plaintiff only in plain and obvious cases and where the court is satisfied that 'the case is beyond doubt':  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (App. Div.) ..."
[10]
The pertinent paragraphs of Rule 419(1) are as follows:
"Rule 419.(1) The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or anything in any pleading to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that
"(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be,
. . . . .
"(c) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious,"
[11]
With respect to the grounds stated in Rule 419(1)(a), it is important to note that it requires that there be "no
reasonable
cause of action". The significance of this language was clearly explained by Pratte, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 736 (F.C.T.D.) where he said that the inclusion of the word "reasonable" means that the court need not decide whether the suit is truly founded in law but instead whether, assuming all the facts alleged in the statement of claim to be true, the plaintiff has an "arguable case". LeDain, J., said in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 450, 487 S.C.R. I understand this to mean that a judge hearing such a motion should not strike out a statement of claim just because he does not think the plaintiff's case is sound in law, if it is possible that a trial judge might uphold the claim.
[12]
Counsel for the applicant in the present motion appeared at times to take the position that if it could be shown that there was no question of fact remaining at issue (or at least not admitted for the purposes of this motion), and if the remaining issues in the action were questions of law only, then the court should decide those questions of law on a motion to strike out the pleadings for want of any reasonable cause of action. In other words, the court should decide the matter on such a motion as if it were dealing with an application under Rule 474 for a preliminary determination of a question of law. To this end he admitted for the purposes of this motion that the plaintiffs were the relevant descendants of bands which had, prior to 1868 (the year of the adoption of the first Indian Act) the aboriginal right to control the membership in their respective bands. He contended, however, that as a matter of law such rights had been extinguished by treaty and by statute long before the adoption of the Constitution Act, 1982, s. 35 (which guaranteed "existing" aboriginal rights) with the result that no such aboriginal right to the control of band membership "existed" in 1982. The question of extinguishment was argued at some length by both sides.
[13]
I do not accept that such questions of law could or must be determined on such a motion. I understood Rule 419(1)(a) to leave me with the discretion not to strike out the statement of claim where it is not patently clear that the plaintiff's claim is without legal justification. I am satisfied that there are many disputable issues of law with respect to the existence or non-existence, and the abridgement or non-abridgement, of an aboriginal right of the plaintiffs to control their band membership. Without in any way seeking to define the issues for the trial, it appears to me that there are many arguable legal issues such as the effect of the various Indian Acts on such an aboriginal right (assuming it exists as the applicant has done for the purpose of this motion). Did those provisions specifically extinguish band control? Did they "occupy the field" with the effect of extinguishment by implication of any control by the bands? What is the proper interpretation of Treaties 6, 7, and 8 to which the ascendants of these plaintiffs were allegedly parties? These are all matters which must be canvassed at more length and with greater care. The argument on this motion, even though it took some three and one half days, did not permit me more than an overview of some of these matters.
[14]
Further, with respect to the relief sought by the plaintiffs for a declaration that the 1985 amendments infringe their freedom of association as guaranteed by s. 2(d) of the Charter, I believe this is also an arguable claim which is by no means patently without merit. It will be necessary to consider whether the Indian bands represented by the plaintiffs are "associations" within the meaning of the Charter. Must such associations be purely consensual? Can it be said that bands which have included certain members by force of law are consensual associations? Also it is contended by the applicant that to the extent, if any, that there is impairment of freedom of association, this is a limitation supportable by s. 1 of the Charter or is in aid of the vindication of other Charter rights such as those in s. 15 or s. 28. Without now going into all of the difficult issues which will be involved in the interpretation of the various Charter sections, suffice it to say that the invocation of s. 1 by the applicant will almost certainly involve questions of fact as to whether the 1985 amendments are reasonable and demonstrably justified within the meaning of that section. The applicant urges that no evidence will be necessary here because the justification of the 1985 amendments is self-evident. It may be self-evident to the applicant but, as pointed out by the respondents, even if the applicant chooses to meet the possible onus on it under s. 1 by means of argument alone, it will be open to the respondents (plaintiffs) to rebut the applicant's (defendant's) position with evidence. Such evidence could go to the question of "proportionality" and "impact" of the 1985 amendments, such matters clearly being relevant and probably requiring the introduction of evidence: see e.g.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 137-40 S.C.R.
[15]
It is therefore not possible to say that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action and I am dismissing motion (1) as based on paragraph 419(1)(a) of the Rules.
[16]
I am also dismissing motion (1) as based on the grounds of paragraph 419(1)(c) of the Rules that the statement of claim is "scandalous, frivolous, or vexatious". If it cannot be said that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, then
fortiori
it cannot be said that it is frivolous or vexatious.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). (Counsel for the applicant abandoned during argument his assertion in the notice of motion that the statement of claim was also "scandalous").
[17]
Motion (2)
- In this motion the applicant asks that an order be made under Rule 419(1)(a), (d) and (f) that the statement of claim be struck out on the grounds that:
"(a) the named plaintiffs are not entitled to bring the within action on behalf of all the other members of their respective Bands; and
"(b) the plaintiffs are not entitled to bring the within action as a class action."
It will be noted that with respect to each of the individual plaintiffs named in the style of cause he sued "on his own behalf and on behalf of all other members of the ... Band". The statement of claim was amended on April 14, 1986, with the addition of the following paragraph:
"
The other members of the Sawridge Band, the Sturgeon Lake Band, the Ermineskin Band, the Enoch Band, the Sarcee Band and the Blackfoot Band on whose behalf the said Walter Patrick Twinn, John Daniel McLean, Wayne Roan, Raymond Cardinal, Bruce Starlight and Andrew Bear Robe are suing, respectively, do not include persons who purportedly have become members of any of the said Bands by virtue of the operation of sections 8 to 14.3, both inclusive, of the
, as amended by section 4 of an Act entitled '
An Act to Amend the Indian Act
The applicant contends, inter alia: that the individual plaintiffs cannot sue on behalf of all of the members of the band because they purport to represent the bands as established by the Indian Act, but pursuant to the current Indian Act these bands include as well the very people whose entry they are seeking to challenge and it is said they cannot define the "band" for their own purposes so as to exclude these people; that the bands also include people who may be status Indians but who are not aboriginals and therefore cannot claim aboriginal rights; that the plaintiffs cannot bring a class action because members of the bands do not have a common interest for reasons stated above; and that the action cannot be maintained as a class action because the plaintiffs have not specified the names of the persons they represent nor do they indicate in the amended statement of claim that the persons they purport to represent have consented to the action.
[19]
At the hearing counsel for the applicant also sought to introduce two affidavits recently received by him from members of the band indicating that they were not in favour of this action. Counsel first raised this matter on the third day of the hearing and I refused to allow him to file the affidavits for reasons which I will state below.
[20]
I indicated at the hearing that I would dismiss this motion for the following reasons. What are being sought here by the plaintiffs are declarations that a certain law of Parliament is unconstitutional because it abridges a freedom guaranteed by s. 2 of the Charter and/or an aboriginal right guaranteed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. I start with the proposition that, as Laskin, J., said in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 1 N.R. 225 at 163 S.C.R., "... the right of the citizenry to constitutional behaviour by Parliament where the issue in such behaviour is justiciable as a legal question" will support standing by a plaintiff to seek a declaration of invalidity of a law. It is possible, although I need not and do not decide the matter, that the six individual plaintiffs named in the style of cause could have sought the declarations requested in the statement of claim. In any event, it is entirely appropriate that the other members of the band other than the "returnees" introduced by virtue of the 1985 amendments should be joined as plaintiffs in a class action under Rule 1711. Basically, aboriginal rights are communal rights and it is therefore appropriate that those persons who claim to belong to the relevant community to which the right adheres should be joined as plaintiffs in an action to vindicate those rights: see Attorney-General for  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 331-32 (Ont. H.C.). It is fundamental to the case of the plaintiffs that the aboriginal right in question here - the right of each band to control its own membership - is one which adheres to the group as it was constituted before the coming into force of the amendments on April 17, 1985. The plaintiffs are certainly entitled to frame their action on that basis and it will remain to be seen whether they can make out their case in fact or in law. If they are able to do so, it will emerge that the bands are they describe them in the amended statement of claim are the legal bands. In effect the applicant is contending that they should not be allowed to sue on this basis because they may not succeed in their action. This is a circular argument which might itself be characterized as frivolous or vexatious.
[21]
Nor would it be appropriate to dismiss the action because some of the members of the band may have a more tenuous claim to participate in aboriginal rights. It is far from clear what the meaning of "aboriginal" is as that word is used in s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and many of the persons referred to by counsel for the applicant as being non-aboriginal may come within it. Apart from that, such persons may well have a direct interest in the outcome of an action for a declaration that the "returnees" may not be admitted to the band, even if such plaintiffs are not themselves aboriginals. It may well affect their share of band assets and their way of life on the reserve. Further, by the test of the Thorson case and those which have followed it they surely at least have a sufficient interest in ensuring "constitutional behaviour by Parliament" in relation to guaranteed aboriginal rights. I might also add that, as the plaintiffs are asserting Treaty rights as well, the class action seems necessary as a few individuals could not sue to enfore such rights: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 30 (T.D.).
[22]
Having reached these conclusions, I rejected the introduction of the affidavits from two band members on the grounds that they raised new issues at a very late date in the hearing. Had I thought they could be determinative of the question of the standing of the other plaintiffs, I might have adjourned the matter for further argument and perhaps cross-examination on the affidavits. However, it appeared to me that the accord or non-accord of two members of the band could not be a basis for dismissing the action. It appears from the authorities that in a class action it is not necessary that the named plaintiffs obtain the consent of other members of the class before commencing the action: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. H.C.). If there are some members of the class who do not wish to join in as plaintiffs, they can be added as defendants: Sugden case at 673. Most of the cases cited by counsel for the applicant where class actions had not been allowed involved claims for damages or something akin to damages where the specific interest of each member of the class was somehow different. In my view these cases have little or no application to an action for a declaration that an Act of Parliament is unconstitutional.
[23]
I therefore am dismissing motion (2), but without prejudice to the rights of any person to apply to be excluded from the action or to be added as a defendant. I also made it clear that if evidence were to be brought - and there is no indication that any such evidence exists - that this action is a complete sham with little or no support in the bands on whose behalf it is brought, the court might have to consider further an action to strike the statement of claim. But that is not the situation before me.
[24]
Motion (3)
- This is a motion in the alternative to strike certain portions of the statement of claim. I am granting some parts of this motion and following are my reasons.
[25]
I will order that the second sentence of paragraph 5 of the amended statement of claim be struck out on the ground that it is not material and is potentially vexatious because of the breadth of matters which it raises. The Crown's "dealings with the Indian Nations" is not directly relevant to the claim at the beginning of this paragraph that the plaintiff band existed as distinct entities prior to entering into Treaties. Whatever the second sentence may mean by its reference to "Indian Nations", it does not state a material fact that would tend to prove directly the propositions set out in the first sentence. Leave will be given to amend the statement of claim by replacing the second sentence with some allegation, if the plaintiffs think appropriate, that the Crown had recognized their bands prior to the making of Treaties 6, 7, and 8.
[26]
With respect to paragraph 9 of the statement of claim, I would first observe that it appears to be a statement of law with nothing more. While this may not be necessary or appropriate, it is relatively harmless. By Rule 412(2), it does not, of course, imply any allegation of material facts to support this conclusion of law. I will therefore not strike it out, but I will return to this matter with respect to motion (4) concerning the particulars because I think the plaintiffs must clearly elect as to whether they are going to treat this merely as a question of law, and stand or fall on that, or whether they are going to seek to aduce evidence to "prove" the existence of this aboriginal right by practice and custom. In the latter case they must give some particulars and I think the issues must be narrowed to the facts relevant to the plaintiff bands.
[27]
These comments on paragraph 9 apply equally well to paragraph 11 of the amended statement of claim.
[28]
Paragraph 13, as a simple though vague statement of law, is not useful pleading but I fail to see how it can prejudice the defendant. It can not imply any allegation of relevant facts.
[29]
Paragraphs 14 and 15, again as interpretations of a statute are rather peculiar in a document which is supposed to focus on "the material facts on which the party pleading relies". Recognizing again, however, in accordance with Rule 412(2) that they cannot be accepted "as a substitute for a statement of material facts on which the conclusion of law is based" and that no allegation of fact is to be implied from them, I see no harm in leaving the paragraphs in the amended statement of claim.
[30]
While it appears to me that paragraph 16 does allege facts which are potentially relevant to constitutional issues such as the application of s. 1 of the Charter, I shall not strike it out but have more to say about it in dealing with the motion for particulars.
[31]
Motion (4)
- This is a motion in the alternative for an order under Rule 415 to require the plaintiffs to provide the particulars set out in the Demand for Particulars dated May 22, 1986, and served by the defendant on the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs have failed to provide the particulars demanded. The defendant further asks that it be given 30 days after receipt of such particulars as ordered to file its defence.
[32]
I am not going to order the particulars referred to in paragraph 1 of the Demand. These have to do with knowledge of and consent to the action by the band members. For the reasons set out earlier, I do not believe it necessary for the plaintiffs to particularize in their pleadings such information. This paragraph also seeks particulars as to whether any of the members of the plaintiffs bands are non-aboriginals. This information is surely available to the defendant and I doubt that any further information is needed by it in order to plead. It can of course seek further specifics on examination for discovery if such information can be shown to be relevant to the pleadings.
[33]
Paragraph 2 of the Demand seeks further and better particulars in relation to paragraph 5 of the amended statement of claim. I have already struck out the second sentence of paragraph 5 but have given the plaintiffs leave to amend this paragraph by replacing the second sentence, if they wish, with some allegation that the Crown had recognized their bands prior to the making of Treaties 6, 7, and 8. If they so plead they should then specify the nature, form, and appropriate dates of such recognition.
[34]
The particulars sought in paragraph 3 of the Demand are simply vexatious and have no relevance to the matters in issue. They will not be ordered.
[35]
Paragraph 4 of the Demand seeks particulars with respect to paragraphs 9 and 12 of the amended statement of claim. With respect to paragraph 9 of the amended statement of claim, I have already indicated with respect to motion (3) that if it is the intention of the plaintiffs to adduce any evidence to prove the existence of the aboriginal rights referred to therein, then they must provide some particulars as to the institutions and practices of bands of which they are the successors upon which they may rely in asserting the continuing existence of an aboriginal right of each band to control its own membership. With respect to paragraph 12 of the statement of claim I will not order the particulars as requested because in my view paragraph 12 only alleges a mixed proposition of law and fact as to the interpretation of Treaties 6, 7, and 8. The plaintiffs will, of course, be obliged to show that they are the successors of the Indian signatories of these treaties in the course of proving the allegations in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim.
[36]
With respect to paragraph 5 of the Demand, concerning paragraph 11 of the amended statement of claim, I will order particulars on the same terms as I have done with respect to paragraph 9. That is, if the plaintiffs intend to rely on this as anything more than a general statement of law, and instead use it as a basis for adducing evidence as to the practices in institutions of their bands with respect to control of membership prior to the signing of Treaties 6, 7, and 8 respectively, then they must provide particulars of those institutions and practices. In my view this paragraph can be seen as relevant, for the purposes of this action, only to the extent that it alleges rights of these bands, not of Indian bands in general.
[37]
With respect to paragraph 6 of the Demand, relating to paragraph 12 of the statement of claim, I have already dealt above with that paragraph of the statement of claim and am not ordering particulars in respect thereto.
[38]
Nor will I order particulars of the relevant Statutes of Canada as requested in paragraph 7 of the Demand. These are questions of law which will be the subject of argument. One might question the utility of paragraph 13 of the statement of claim in this respect but it does at least explain in a general way the position of the plaintiffs. While there may be cases where a court should order particulars as to statutes relied on, I cannot think in the present case that the defendant will be taken by surprise as to the relevant statutory provisions, particularly after the hearing of these motions.
[39]
With respect to paragraph 8 of the Demand, where the defendant seeks particulars as to which of the plaintiff bands if any have assumed control of their own membership and the particulars of any relevant bylaws adopted by them, this is surely information already in the possession of the defendant and I will order no particulars in this respect.
[40]
With respect to paragraph 9 of the Demand, seeking further particulars in relation to paragraph 16 of the amended statement of claim, it appears to me that what the defendant is seeking is more in the nature of evidence than of facts. I am unable to see that it will be impeded in pleading to this paragraph by an absence of particulars and I will therefore not order them. No doubt the allegations in paragraph 16 of the amended statement of claim can be the subject of extensive examination for discovery.
[41]
With respect to paragraph 10 of the Demand, I will not order particulars as requested in sub-sub-paragraph (a)(i) as the existence of predecessor bands is adequately alleged in paragraph 5 of the amended statement of claim and any additional particulars being requested are more in the nature of a search for evidence rather than facts. With respect to sub-sub-paragraph (a)(ii) the defendant must surely be in possession of sufficient information to plead in respect of this matter and further information can be sought by discovery. With respect to sub-paragraph (b) what the defendant is seeking are essentially statements of law and/or the evidence by which the plaintiffs will attempt to prove the infringement of rights. Particulars will not be ordered for these purposes.
[42]
As I am ordering some particulars to be provided, I will as requested by the defendant allow 30 days from the date of service on it of the particulars ordered for the defendant to file his defence.
[43]
Costs
- While the defendant has been succesful to a very limited degree in obtaining portions of the relief sought in motions (3) and (4), the majority of the hearing was devoted to motions (1) and (2) in which the defendant was not successful. Those were undoubtedly the more fundamental and important motions. I am therefore ordering that the defendant pay the costs of the entire application.
Motions allowed in part.
