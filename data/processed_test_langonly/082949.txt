: This is an application for judicial review of the decision by Ms. L. Hill, the Minister's delegate, to refer a report to the Minister recommending an admissibility hearing pursuant to section 44 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
On December 5, 2003, Mr. Justice Rouleau of this Court dismissed an application for a stay of a deportation order that was to be executed on December 8, 2003. In his ruling, Justice Rouleau refers to yet another file, IMM-7023-03, this one an application for judicial review of a decision rendered by the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) dismissing an appeal of the deportation order.
The applicant was born in India on January 18, 1980. His parents were divorced in 1981. His father had a drug addiction, and allegedly tried to sell him for drugs when he was three or four years old. At the age of seven, he witnessed his mother burn to death. His maternal uncle, Amin Ismael, a Canadian citizen, went to India, became his legal guardian and brought him back to Canada. Mr. Ismael raised the applicant as his son, but the applicant never became a Canadian citizen.
[4]
When the applicant was sixteen, conflicts with his aunt and uncle led him to leave the house. He had difficulty holding a job, and fell into criminal activities with a gang.
[5]
He was convicted of possession of stolen goods, driving without insurance or a licence. He became involved in drug trafficking, and was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, as well as belonging to a criminal organization. For these last two offences, to which he pled guilty, he was sentenced to 5 years and 6 months in jail.
[6]
While serving his sentence in Drumheller, Alberta, a report was made for the purposes of the former
Immigration Act
, section 27. With the change of legislation that came into effect in 2002, the report is now discretionary under section 44, but the section 27 report can still be used for the purposes of section 44 under Regulation 321 of the new
. Under the
, report is forwarded to the Minister (or his delegate) who may refer the report to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing.
[7]
In the applicant's case, the report was referred by the Minister's delegate to the Immigration Division, which ruled that the applicant was inadmissible on the grounds of serious criminality and thus had to be removed. The Appeal Division dismissed the appeal of the deportation order. The deportation order was enforced on December 8, 2003. The applicant was deported from Vancouver to India.
Did the Minister's delegate commit a reviewable error by referring the report to the Minister recommending an admissibility hearing?
Preliminary Matters
[9]
The respondent submitted that the style of cause should be changed to reflect the fact that it is now the Solicitor General, as head of the CBSA, who would be responsible for matters of inadmissibility; the applicant agrees, therefore pursuant to Order in Council P.C. 2003-2061 of 12 December 2003 and Order in Council P.C. 2003-2063 also dated December 12, 2003, the style of cause is amended to name the Solicitor General of Canada styled Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness as respondent.
[10]
The respondent also raised the issue of mootness, given that the applicant had already been deported. However, section 52(2) of the
provides for the possibility of the removal order being set aside by judicial review and the foreign national being entitled to return to Canada at the expense of the Minister. The respondent argued that the applicant did not seek judicial review of the deportation order; since the applicant had been deported, there was no longer a live controversy between the parties.
[11]
The fact of the deportation is not in itself an indicator of mootness, as shown by section 52(2) of the
. The applicant has sought judicial review of the decision to refer, rather than the decision to remove, no doubt for strategic reasons. The decision by the Immigration Division was no doubt reasonable and sound, and may be unassailable. Judicial review is not precluded because one ground is preferred over another; since leave was granted by this Court for judicial review, since the possibility exists for the applicant to return according to the
, the issue in this judicial review is not moot.
Standard of Review
[12]
The applicant argued, on the basis of
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the standard of review applicable in this case was reasonableness simpliciter. The respondent Minister contended that it was patent unreasonableness, based on the four factors of the pragmatic and functional approach: "the presence or absence of a privative clause or statutory right of appeal; the expertise of the tribunal relative to that of the reviewing court on the issue in question; the purposes of the legislation and that provision in particular; and, the nature of the question-law, fact, of mixed law and fact." (
In this case, the issue as to whether the standard is one of reasonableness simpliciter or patent unreasonableness will not be determinative to granting judicial review. According to the evidence, it would seem that the decision to refer was reasonable. As the Supreme Court of Canada has stated many times (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207;
Director of Investigation and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) the reasonable decision is not necessarily the one that the reviewing court would have reached, but one which is supported by the facts in evidence. In deciding not to stay the deportation, Justice Rouleau wrote that there was no serious issue which could satisfy the first requirement to granting the stay, because the decision was reasonable and the various factors mentioned by the applicant to challenge it were not sufficient to show it to be unreasonable.
[14]
I agree that the decision to refer the case was reasonable. The decision is based on the report itself, which emphasizes the gravity of the offence and the length of the sentence. Another decision-maker might have been moved by the letters sent in by the family and decided not to refer the report to the Immigration Division. However, there are certainly reasonable grounds to support the decision to refer. Again, the standard of reasonableness does not imply, according to the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada, that the reviewing court would necessarily have arrived at the same result, but only that there are sufficient grounds to justify the decision. Thus, even accepting the standard proposed by the applicant, the decision would withstand the test of reasonableness.
[15]
The question is not whether the Minister's delegate properly applied the guidelines or gave enough weight to relevant factors, but whether there is any evidence that Ms. Hill failed to consider the appropriate factors.
[16]
There is no evidence that the Minister's delegate made a reviewable error that would justify this Court's intervention.
THIS COURT ORDERS that:
(1) This application for judicial review be dismissed.
(2) Counsel for the applicant suggested a serious question:
Whether the execution of a removal order renders moot a judicial review of a decision to refer a permanent resident to an admissibility hearing?
(3) Counsel for the respondent opposed this question suggesting that mootness is a question of facts and should be addressed on a case by case basis in light of the parameters set by the jurisprudence.
(4) I agree with counsel for the respondent, and I do not believe that a serious question of general importance is involved, therefore, no question will be certified.
Application dismissed.
