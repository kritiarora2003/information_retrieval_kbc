Simpson, J.
: The plaintiffs have brought a Motion on the sixth day of trial. They seek production of the full text of certain documents. Fortunately, there appears to be no controversy about the relevant facts.
The Facts
[2]
This ongoing trial began in St. John's, Newfoundland, and ran from September 19th to 21st, 1994. It was then adjourned to resume in Ottawa on April 24th, 1995, because counsel had underestimated the time required for trial.
[3]
During the trial proceedings in Newfoundland, the defendants filed a supplementary affidavit of documents sworn by Pierre Comeau on September 21st, 1994 (the "affidavit of documents"). Sixty-seven documents were listed in Schedule I to the affidavit of documents (Schedule "I").
[4]
Last night, during a conversation with the Hon. Thomas Siddon in preparation for the evidence he is to give on the plaintiffs' behalf today, plaintiffs' counsel noticed for the first time that deletions had been made from item 13 in Schedule I. Item 13 is debriefing notes made following a Minister's Executive Committee Meeting held at a time when Mr. Siddon was Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. He apparently could tell that items had been deleted, but has no recollection of the contents of the deletions.
[5]
It was only in response to my questions in court that counsel for the defendants acknowledged for the first time that seven deletions had been made from item 13. In my view, even with careful study, five of those seven deletions are not apparent. In addition, counsel for the defendants advised that one deletion had been made from item 10 in Schedule I. It is virtually undetectable. Further, two deletions were made in documents listed as item 21 in Schedule I. In my view, neither deletion is readily apparent. Finally, a deletion which is apparent was made on page 1 of item 29 in Schedule I.
[6]
It is noteworthy that the text of Schedule I with respect to items 10, 13, 21 and 29 makes no mention of any deletions from those documents. Anyone reading Schedule I would fairly assume that the documents listed had been produced in their entirety. As well, the preamble to Schedule I provides that no privilege is claimed for the listed documents. Accordingly, one would also assume that the listed documents had been produced without a claim for privilege.
[7]
For these reasons, counsel for the plaintiffs would have had no reason to search for deletions. Further, most of the deletions would not have been obvious even if a search had been made. Accordingly, I am not critical of plaintiffs' counsel's failure to notice the deletions until last evening. I am, however, critical of the defendants' counsel's failure to reveal the deletions until today. In my view, a party to a proceeding in this court who elects to delete material from documents bears an onus to immediately convey the fact that a deletion has been made in clear and unmistakeable terms.
[8]
The affidavit of documents also contains a second Schedule (Schedule "II"). It lists a number of documents for which privilege is claimed. Item 5 in Schedule II is of relevance, and it reads as follows:
"5. Documents subject to a confidence of the Queen's Privy Council of Canada and in respect of which a certificate will be filed pursuant to s. 39 of the
The documents referred to in item 5 were not described. However, the certificate mentioned in item 5 was filed and provided to counsel for the plaintiffs on Monday, April 24th, 1995. That was the first day of the trial in Ottawa this week.
[10]
The certificate is made by Jocelyne Bourgon, Clerk of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Secretary to the Cabinet. It is dated April 13th, 1995 and is made pursuant to s. 39(1) of the
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (the "Certificate").
[11]
The Certificate records that Jocelyne Bourgon has personally examined the listed documents and that they are
"... confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada for the reasons set out in the Schedule attached hereto and I object to the disclosure of these documents and the information contained therein."
[12]
The Certificate includes as Schedule "A" a list of 14 documents (Schedule "A"). As an illustration, the following is the text of the first entry on Schedule "A"
"1.
is a copy of a memorandum the purpose of which is to present proposals or recommendations to Council within the meaning of paragraph 39(2)(a) of the said
Counsel for both parties acknowledged that the reference to "Document #1" as underlined above does not relate to the first document listed in Schedule I to the affidavit of documents. Nor does it relate to the first document in any other document list in material before the court. This is true for all the documents listed in Schedule "A". Any resemblance between any of the 14 document numbers referred to in the text of Schedule "A" and any other document list in this case is random and accidental. Essentially, the documents referred to in Schedule "A" are given no source and a source cannot be identified.
[14]
In this motion I have been asked to address only items 13 and 21 of Schedule I because they are of relevance to Mr. Siddon's evidence and he is waiting to testify as I write these reasons. Item 13 is not presently in evidence. However, item 21 in deleted form is in evidence as Exhibit 59.
Counsel for the defendants takes the position that, although items 13 and 21 were produced in Schedule I as "documents for which no privilege is claimed", privilege was not lost because they were in fact produced with deletions. Further, with respect to item 21, he says that no loss of privilege has occurred because that item became an exhibit in deleted form. Finally, he argues that Schedule II to the affidavit of documents asserts a valid claim for privilege in item 5 even though it contains no description of the documents and he argues that the relevant Certificate has now been filed.
[16]
The plaintiffs, on the other hand, submit that they are entitled to rely on the affidavit of documents and that, by listing items 13 and 21 as documents for which no privilege is claimed, the defendants have lost their privilege and cannot disclose the deletions and claim executive or cabinet privilege at this late date.
Conclusions
[17]
I have concluded that, when the defendant's representative swore the affidavit of documents and included items 13 and 21 as documents for which no privilege was claimed, any privilege is those documents was lost. Had the deletions been referred to in Schedule I such that the production was qualified or had the deletions been mentioned in Schedule II, I would have taken a different view. However, in view of the unconditional production of the documents on the face of the affidavit of production, no privilege can now be claimed for documents listed in Schedule I.
[18]
However, even if the documents for which privilege is claimed had been properly produced in the affidavit on production, the privilege would not have been sustained at trial because it is my view that the Certificate is of no force and effect. This is so because the documents it lists simply cannot be identified. Had the documents described in the text of Schedule "A" to the Certificate in fact tracked the listing in the affidavit of documents, I would have upheld the Certificate, even though on its face it does not give a source for the document numbers it uses. However, when no source reference is given in the Certificate and when the 14 document references in fact have no identifiable source in any of the materials filed in court, the Certificate cannot stand because it is meaningless.
[19]
Canada (Minister of Industry, Trade and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), leave to appeal refused (1991), 128 N.R. 319; 74 D.L.R.(4th) viii (S.C.C.) (note)), the Federal Court of Appeal considered the adequacy of the description of the documents listed in a certificate. It was not concerned with the problem in this case which is that the documents listed cannot be identified. However, at p. 653 the court noted that a judge is entitled to consider whether "the Certificate on its face asserts a privilege within the statutory limitations on claims for privilege by the Executive". For the reasons just given, I am unable to conclude that the Certificate in this case makes any assertion at all because the documents containing the information for which confidence is asserted are unknown.
[20]
Finally, Schedule II, item 5 to the affidavit of documents is of no assistance in the absence of a meaningful Certificate because item 5 does not describe the documents for which executive privilege is claimed.
[21]
Accordingly, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the claim for executive privilege in respect of items 13 and 21 fails and they are to be produced in their entirety.
Application allowed.
