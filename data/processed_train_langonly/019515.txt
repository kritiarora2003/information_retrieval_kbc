[orally]: Section 69.1 (7) of the
Immigration Act
requires that a Convention refugee hearing be heard by a two member panel. In the absence of a consent by the claimant, as contemplated under s. 69.1(8), the Board lacks the jurisdiction to hear the claim.
[2]
Where the claimant does consent, he or she no longer has the benefit of any disagreement between the two members hearing the claim as provided in s. 69.1(10).
[3]
As the absence of consent goes directly to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear the claim and given the benefit being waived, the consent must be on the record in clear and unequivocal terms.
[4]
In this case, there is no consent in writing nor was there verbal consent at the hearing, accordingly the single member lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter.
[5]
For these reasons, the judicial review will be allowed, the decision dated March 14, 1999 will be set aside and the matter will be remitted back for rehearing by a differently constituted panel.
[6]
Neither party submitted a question for certification.
It is hereby ordered that the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated March 14, 1999 is set aside and the matter is remitted back for rehearing by a differently constituted panel.
Application allowed.
