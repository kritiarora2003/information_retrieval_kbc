McKeown, J.
: The applicant, a citizen of Turkey, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Convention Refugee Determination Division (hereinafter called the Board) dated September 1, 1993, wherein the applicant was held not to be a Convention refugee.
[2]
The issue in this case relates to the application and scope of the exclusion clause, subs. F(a) of Article 1 which is in Schedule 1 to the
Immigration Act
. The Board considered whether the applicant had committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity so as to preclude him from seeking protection under the Convention.
[3]
The applicant raised issues in connection with three statements by the Board. The Board stated at p. 3 of its reasons:
"... Mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences will be sufficient for exclusion from refugee status where the organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, which may, by necessity, involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts ...
"... The claimant's degree of involvement in the crime indicates culpability on his part within the meaning of <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ..."
[4]
The Board concludes at p. 4 of its reasons:
"... Because of its terrorist nature, membership is sufficient to provide knowledge of the kind of violence it proposes and disposes ..."
[5]
The applicant submitted that these three statements raised four issues, two of which in my view are important issues, while the other two can be easily dealt with. The applicant states the issues are: 1) Did the Board properly state the principles of
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 173 (F.C.A.) (cited to F.C.), in saying that mere membership is sufficient for exclusion from refugee status; and 2) Did the Board properly apply the principles to the facts in this case? The applicant also states that the Board did not reasonably assess the evidence and there was a denial of natural justice when the Board refused to make a finding as to whether there was a well founded fear of persecution. In my view there was documentary evidence upon which the Board could have reached the conclusions it did with respect to the Dev Yol. Subsection F(a) of Article 1 clearly states that once the Board has made a determination that the claimant falls within the defined excluded class, the provisions of the Convention do not apply. The Board is therefore under no obligation to assess the evidence to determine whether or not the claimant has suffered persecution, as this finding would be moot. In
"... Exclusion clauses, ... are completely external to the characteristics of a refugee and to both the genuineness and the reasonableness of his fear of persecution on the grounds stated, if he is sent back to his country of origin."
[6]
In the same decision, Desjardins, J.A., states at p. 615:
"It is clear that someone who falls within the exclusions contained in ss. E and F of the Convention may in no way claim the protection offered by Canada to Convention refugees. In a case where the evidence admits of no doubt, the Refugee Division, ... can never give such a person Convention refugee status."
[7]
I will return to the first issue because in my view the Board has misstated the test in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The court held in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at p. 317:
"What degree of complicity, then, is required to be an accomplice or abettor? A first conclusion I come to is that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient for exclusion from refugee status ...
. . . . .
"It seems apparent, however, that where an organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may by necessity involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts."
[8]
The Court of Appeal seems to be saying that normally, mere membership in a terrorist organization is insufficient to bring a claimant into the excluded class. In some limited cases, however, where the organization is "primarily directed to a limited brutal purpose", the Board may exercise discretion in determining whether or not, by necessary implication, the claimant engaged in "personal and knowing participation".
[9]
Here, the Board found that the Dev Yol's activities are "principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose", and that membership in this group may necessarily imply personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts. The implication is that the Board did not feel it necessary to determine whether or not mens rea existed. The respondent submitted that there was sufficient evidence to justify a finding of personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts on the evidence, but the Board did not reach that conclusion. Instead, the Board stated that because of the terrorist nature of Dev Yol, membership in the organization is sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant had knowledge of the kind of violence the organization proposes and disposes. In my view the Board did not ask itself whether there was sufficient evidence, given the applicant's circumstances, to support the finding by necessary implication. Mens rea is quite important in this case especially since the applicant was between the ages of 11 and 13 when he was an active member of Dev Yol. There is conflicting evidence on whether he could have been active in the normal sense of the word after his detention at the age of 13 years.
[10]
Justice Robertson in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), stated the test in much the same terms as Justice MacGuigan had in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, when he stated at p. 321:
"It is well settled that mere membership in an organization involved in international offences is not sufficient basis on which to invoke the exclusion clause ... An exception to this general rule arises where the organization is one whose very existence is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means deemed necessary."
[11]
In both <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> and <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> it was recognized that some groups might be established or might be operated with the sole intent and purpose of violently and brutally bringing about a course of events. Clearly, where such a group exists, it can generally be assumed that its members intentionally and voluntarily joined and remained in the group for the common purpose of actively adding their personal efforts to the group's cause. This assumption gives rise to a presumption of complicity on the part of any refugee claimant who was found to be a member of such a group. This presumption of complicity is clearly rebuttable. Justice MacGuigan never stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> that membership in terrorist or secret police types of organizations automatically resulted in exclusion. He merely stated that such membership might, by necessary implication, give rise to a finding of complicity.
[12]
In my view MacGuigan, J.A., indicated that this is what the Board had to do to find complicity when he stated in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> at p. 316:
"From the premise that mens rea interpretation is required, I find that the standard of 'some personal activity involving persecution', understood as implying a mental element or knowledge, is a useful specification of mens rea in this context. Clearly, no one can 'commit' international crimes without personal and knowing participation."
[13]
"At the bottom, complicity rests in such cases, I believe, on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it."
[14]
The Board also appears to have failed to link any specific crime against humanity to the applicant. In other cases the courts have said it is desirable to have such evidence.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), Linden, J.A., states at p. 207:
"Given the seriousness of the possible consequences of the denial of the appellant's claim on the basis of s. F(a) of article 1 of the Convention to the appellant and the relatively low standard of proof required of the Minister, it is crucial that the Refugee Division set out in its reasons those crimes against humanity for which there are serious reasons to consider that a claimant has committed them. In failing to make the required findings of fact, I believe that the Refugee Division can be said to have made an error of law."
[15]
In the present case there is reference to only one crime against humanity which took place in 1981 after the applicant had been in detention for a period of eight months.
[16]
While I agree with the respondent that the applicant need not have been personally involved in the violence, there should be an analysis by the Board as to how the applicant shared the Dev Yol's common purpose and had knowledge of some of the acts of violence. I am not prepared to say that a sympathizer has a shared common purpose such as to make the person subject to the exclusion clause. It is up to the Board to decide where the applicant had sufficient knowledge of the nature of Dev Yol.
[17]
Accordingly, the application for judicial review is allowed. The decision of the Board is set aside and the matter is referred to a differently constituted Board to be determined in a manner not inconsistent with these reasons.
[18]
The applicant sought to have the following question certified: Is mere membership in a terrorist organization sufficient to exclude a person from the refugee process? In my view and the view of the respondent it is not a question of general public importance in light of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision. One has to apply the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision to the facts in each case. I decline to certify the question as a serious question of general public importance.
Application allowed.
