: Yosyp Stanislavsky and Galyna Stanislavska (the "Applicants") seek judicial review of the decision of Immigration Counsellor David Rydygier (the "Officer"). In his decision, dated August 13, 2002, the Officer denied the Applicants' request for restoration of their temporary resident status in Canada.
[2]
The Applicants, who are married to each other, are citizens of Ukraine. They entered Canada in July 2000, as visitors. They have two sons who are Canadian citizens and who live in Canada. In 2000, the purpose of the Applicants' visit was to look after the ill mother of Mr. Stanislavsky. The mother died in August 2001, leaving property in Canada. Mr. Stanislavsky was a beneficiary of her estate.
[3]
The Applicants' visitor visas were extended until February 2002. Their request for a further extension was denied by a letter dated May 6, 2002. The Applicants' visitor status expired and by an application dated May 27, 2002, they applied for restoration of their visitor status.
[4]
On or about May 27, 2002, the Applicants made application for permanent residence in Canada. This application for permanent residence was sponsored by the Applicants' son Igor. The covering letter from counsel for the Applicants which accompanied the application for permanent residence referred to the sponsorship of the son Igor and set out some reasons why he wanted his parents to live in Canada. Those reasons included the son's decision to assist his parents in their advancing years. The covering letter which accompanied the Applicants' application for restoration of their visitor status, dated May 28, 2002, set out the fact that they had submitted a sponsored application for permanent residence and reasons why they wished to remain in Canada pending the outcome of that application.
[5]
By a decision dated August 13, 2002, the Officer denied the Applicants' request for restoration of temporary resident status in Canada. The refusal was in the form of a standard letter which provided as follows:
This refers to your application for:
- Temporary Resident Status Extension
- Study Permit
- Work Permit
- Temporary Resident Permit
- Restoration of Temporary Resident Status
We regret to inform you that we are unable to approve your request.
It appears your original reason or purpose for coming to Canada has been satisfied. Your application is therefore refused.
You are required to leave Canada Immediately. Failure to depart Canada may result in enforcement action being initiated against you. Enclosed please find a Voluntary Confirmation of departure letter, which you are asked to present to immigration officials at your port of exit."
[6]
The Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System ("CAIPS") notes provided the following information:
REQUEST FOR RESTORATION REFUSED ---- NO CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE
THE FACT THAT AFL SUBMITTED NOT RELEVANT BECAUSE OF LONG PROCESSING TIME AT VEGREVILLE
The Applicants now argue that the Officer erred in making the negative decision because he based his decision on the fact that the original reason for their entry into Canada had come to an end. The Applicants say that this is an error because it ignores the recognition in the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2002, c. 27 (the "
") and the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the "
Regulations
") that persons who apply for permanent residence in Canada are not consequently precluded from remaining as visitors. In this regard, the Applicants rely on section 22(2) of the
and section 183 of the
Regulations
.
[8]
The Applicants submit that the Officer ignored relevant evidence in reaching the negative decision, specifically the evidence relating to the fact that the application was one in the family class, that the male Applicant's mother had recently died, that he was a beneficiary of her estate and his presence was required to deal with administration of that estate and that the Applicants' son Igor desired that his parents remain in Canada with him for emotional support. According to the Applicants, this was all relevant information that was before the Officer but there was no indication that he considered any of these facts when making his decision.
[9]
The Respondent submits that the decision of the Officer was a discretionary one and should stand unless there is evidence to show that he failed to exercise his discretion in good faith. The Respondent argues that the Officer did not err in the exercise of his discretion, that the Applicants' circumstances were considered and the decision is justified.
[10]
The Respondent relies on
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where the Court held that the issuance of a visitor's visa is a discretionary one and an applicant bears the burden of showing that their continuing presence in Canada is not contrary to the statutory or regulatory schemes. The Respondent says that here, sections 20(1), 22(1), 22(2) and 26 of the
apply, as well as sections 63, 179, 182 and 183(1) to (4) of the
Regulations
.
[11]
The sole issue arising here is whether the Officer erred in law by failing to consider the totality of the evidence or by ignoring or misconstruing the evidence.
[12]
Sections 20(1)(b), 22(1) and (2), 29(1) and (2) and 47 of

"183(1) Subject to section 185, the following conditions are imposed on all temporary residents:

. . . . .
"185. An officer may impose, vary or cancel the following specific conditions on a temporary resident:
(a) the period authorized for their stay;
(b) the work that they are permitted to engage in, or are prohibited from engaging in, in Canada, including
(i) the type of work,

(iv) the times and periods of the work, and
(v) in the case of a member of a crew, the period within which they must join the means of transportation;

(i) the type of studies or course,
(ii) the educational institution,
(iii) the location of the studies, and
(iv) the times and periods of the studies;
(d) the area within which they are permitted to travel or are prohibited from travelling in Canada; and
(e) the times and places at which they must report for
(i) medical examination, surveillance or treatment, or
(ii) the presentation of evidence of compliance with applicable conditions."
A person seeking a temporary resident permit must have the intention of staying in Canada for a temporary purpose and an officer must be satisfied that such person will leave Canada upon the expiry of status: see sections 20(1)(b) and 29(1) and (2) of the
and
De La  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . In this case, the Officer did not refuse the Applicants' application for restoration of temporary status on the basis that they would not be in Canada for a temporary purpose. On the contrary, the Officer denied the application because the Applicants' stay in Canada would be for a "long" temporary purpose, that is, while awaiting a decision on their application for permanent residence. The extended delay in this regard was attributed to the long processing time in Vegreville, Alberta relative to inland sponsorship applications.
[15]
In my opinion, the fact that the Applicants had submitted an inland sponsorship application was relevant to their intention to remain in Canada for a temporary purpose, that is for the duration of the processing of their landing applications. Granted, this was a new and different temporary purpose from their original temporary purpose when they entered Canada as visitors in July 2000. However, the current statutory and regulatory scheme does not say that a person's initial temporary purpose must remain constant and unchanged. The only requirement is the existence of a "temporary purpose" and in the present case, I find that the Officer did not address his mind to this question in relation to the prevailing personal circumstances of the Applicants. That is a reversible error.
[16]
The Applicants entered Canada in 2000 as visitors. The stated purpose for that trip was to look after the male Applicant's ailing mother. The Applicants obtained one extension to their visitors' visas. They failed to comply with section 185(a) of the
Regulations
, that is, concerning the period authorized for the stay in Canada, but they acted within the time limits imposed by section 182 to seek reinstatement of status; they applied for restoration within 90 days after expiry of their temporary resident status.
[17]
A review of the record in this case suggests that the Officer improperly limited his consideration of the Applicants' application for reinstatement of status to the length of time required for the Respondent's employees to deal with processing of the inland sponsorship application without addressing the existence or otherwise of a current "temporary purpose" for the Applicants' stay in Canada. Accordingly, this application for judicial review is allowed and the matter remitted to a different officer for redetermination. There is no question for certification arising.
