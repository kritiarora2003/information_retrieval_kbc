Federal Court
February 16, 2004.
Brena Parnes, for the applicant;
Mielka Visnic, for the respondent.
Solicitors of Record:
Waldman & Associates, Toronto, Ontario, for the applicant;
Morris Rosenberg, Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.
Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.
[1]
: This stay application arises from a negative Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) dated December 9th, 2003.
[2]
To succeed in a stay application, an applicant must satisfy each element of the test set out in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.).
[3]
Before this Court, the Applicant argued that there were serious issues to be tried, namely that the PRRA Officer:
a) did not properly assess the risk faced by the Applicant at the hands of the LTTE but rather assessed only the risk generally faced by Tamil returnees; and
b) erred in law by finding that there was state protection available to the Applicant in Sri Lanka.
[4]
A close reading of the PRRA Officer's decision reveals that neither of these allegations is supportable. The PRRA Officer, on the basis of the evidence submitted to her, addressed the risks faced by the Applicant (pages 9 and 11 of the Applicant's Record) as well as the state protection available in Sri Lanka (page 11 of the Applicant's Record).
[5]
The evidence before the PRRA Officer was quite sufficient to support her findings.
[6]
What the Applicant really asks for under the rubric of "serious issue" is a re-weighing of the evidence before the PRRA Officer.
[7]
Such a request does not satisfy the requirement of "serious issue" under  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (unreported).
[8]
Accordingly, this request for a stay is denied.
THIS COURT ORDERS
that the motion for a stay of the execution of the removal order is dismissed.
