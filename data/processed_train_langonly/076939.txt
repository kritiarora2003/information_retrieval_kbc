Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: This is an application for leave for judicial review pursuant to section 72 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(the Act) of a decision dated May 28, 2007 by an immigration officer (the officer) in which the applicant was found to be inadmissible for permanent residence by reason of being a member of a terrorist organization pursuant to s. 34(1)(f) of the Act.
[2]
The applicant is a citizen of Pakistan who left the country in April of 1996, filed a refugee claim in Canada on May 15, 1996 and was granted refugee status on July 23, 1997.
[3]
The applicant admitted his membership in the Muttahida Qaumi Movement - Altaf (MQM-A) and detailed his activities as a member of this group during a May 12, 1998 interview with the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS). In his Personal Information Form, the applicant disclosed his political membership and activities in Pakistan since 1985.
[4]
In his decision, the officer indicated that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the MQM-A had engaged in terrorist activities based on objective documentary evidence. Accordingly, the applicant was found inadmissible for permanent residence.
In determining the appropriate standard of review in a given case, reasonableness or correctness, the Supreme Court of Canada, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at para. 62, instructed that before engaging in a
standard of review analysis, courts should first "ascertain whether the jurisprudence already determined in a satisfactory manner the degree of defence to be accorded with regard to a particular category of question." The standard of review applicable to a determination of whether an organization is one for which there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged, or will engage in acts of terrorism pursuant to s. 34(1)(f) has been found to be that of reasonableness (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 763 (QL), at para. 15;
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 320 (QL), at paras. 19-20;
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 1156 (QL), at para. 12).
[6]
Thus, the standard of review applicable to the present case remains that of reasonableness. Accordingly, the analysis of the officer's decision will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] [...] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47).
The crux of the present case involves determining whether the officer committed a reviewable error when he concluded that the applicant was inadmissible on security grounds for being a member of a terrorist organization pursuant to s. 34(1)(f) of the Act.
[8]
I note at the outset that the applicant was granted refugee status and thus was found to face persecution should he be returned to Pakistan. Therefore, any subsequent finding of inadmissibility should be carried out with prudence, and established with the utmost clarity. I find the comments of my colleague Madam Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1210 (QL), at para. 41 particularly instructive:
An exclusion finding is extremely significant to an applicant. Caution must be exercised to ensure such findings are properly made. The court will not substitute its opinion for that of the decision-maker when the analysis and basis for the decision are reasonable. That is not the situation here. A finding of exclusion must provide some basis for the determination regarding the nature of the group and the determination regarding an applicant's membership in the group. Failure to address both and to provide a basis for both, in my view, yields a result that falls far short of being reasonable.
[9]
Given that the applicant admitted to being a member of the MQM-A organization, what is to be reviewed by this Court is the officer's determination that the MQM-A is "an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c)" (s.34(1)(f) of the Act).
[10]
Section 33 of the Act indicates that the facts constituting inadmissibility under section 34 include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, are determined on a standard of "reasonable grounds to believe." The standard "reasonable grounds to believe" is met when there is more than mere suspicion, but less than a balance of probabilities, based on credible evidence (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2005] F.C.J. No. 587, (QL), at para. 22).
[11]
Subsequently, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 763 (QL), at para. 18, Deputy Justice Max Teitelbaum held that "the assessment of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that an organization has engaged in acts of terrorism is a two-step analysis". The first step involves a factual determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the organization in question committed the acts of violence attributed to it. At the second step of the analysis, a determination is made as to whether those acts constitute acts of terrorism. The officer must provide the definition of terrorism relied upon and explain how the listed acts meet that definition (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 320 (QL), at para. 32).
[12]
The applicant challenges the officer's findings at both steps outlined above and further challenges the officer's decision on the ground that he failed to consider whether the MQM-A,
as an organization
, engaged in acts of terrorism.
[13]
With respect to the first step, the officer examined the documentary evidence indicating that the MQM-A committed acts of violence against the civilian population, including journalists and other political groups during the period in which the applicant was a member. This documentation revealed that the organization has been accused of being involved in acts of murder, torture, and general violence accompanying its political activities.
[14]
With respect to the related issue of whether the MQM-A,
as an organization
, engaged in acts of terrorism, the applicant submits that violence was not part of MQM-A's objectives. While there is no legal requirement for evidence that the organization "sanctioned or approved" of the acts forming part of the s. 34(1)(f) analysis, the officer must assess whether there is enough evidence to establish that they were indeed sanctioned (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 763 (QL), at para. 38).
[15]
The applicant submits that the officer could not conclude that MQM-A engaged in violence because it did not form part of the organization's objectives. I disagree. This determination is a factual one, based on the documentary evidence which involves not only the statements of the leadership or an organization's members but also their actions. The analysis does not lend itself well to a simple tally of members who openly support violent acts; however, at some point, the magnitude and frequency of violent tactics employed by the organization in question will make it difficult to classify the perpetrators as merely rogue members acting outside the will of the group.
[16]
The officer examined documentary evidence emanating from sources such as Amnesty International, the UK Home Office, and the US Department of Justice, which led him to conclude that instances of killing and torture are a "continuous and regular part" of the MQM-A organization. Further, the officer noted an Amnesty International Report entitled "Pakistan: Human rights crisis in Karachi" (February 1996) which stated that "Despite protestation by MQM leader Altaf Hussain that the MQM does not subscribe to violence, there is overwhelming evidence and a consensus among observers in Karachi that some MQM party members have used violent means to further their political ends". Given the evidence before the officer, I am unable to conclude that his determination that MQM-A committed violent acts, including murder and torture, was unreasonable.
[17]
As pertains to the second step, the case law reveals that the evaluating officer must refer to the specific definition of terrorism used and analyze how the acts cited above fit within it (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 320 (QL), at para. 32;
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2004] F.C.J. No. 1416 (QL), at paras. 63-64. The officer made reference to s. 83.01 of the
of Canada, as well as the annexed list of treaties to the
United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism
as fundamental guidelines in his analysis. Further, he reproduced the definition of terrorism provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (QL), at para. 98 which indicates that terrorism includes any "act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act".
[18]
I note that in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 173 (QL), at para. 46, Madam Justice Dawson correctly emphasized the need to properly and explicitly characterize the acts in question as terrorism: "[a] cts such as kidnapping, assault and murder are undoubtedly criminal, but are not necessarily acts of terrorism. It was incumbent on the officer to explain why she viewed them to be terrorist acts." The officer in the present case followed this jurisprudential guidance and stated that MQM-A's activities, including torture and execution of political opponents and journalists, was carried out in furtherance of the organization's political goals.
[19]
According to the applicant, the officer misconstrued the evidence which showed general political violence in Pakistan by all political parties. However, in my view, the existence of general violence does not preclude a determination that an organization engages in terrorism. The existence of generalized violence is part of the context within which the officer conducts his analysis, but is not dispositive of the end determination. Indeed, terrorist acts are committed during an array of country conditions ranging from periods of relative peace to those of widespread strife and conflict.
[20]
The applicant further argues that the officer misconstrued the evidence relating to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) and CSIS. Specifically, he refers to a report dated February 1, 1999, prepared by CSIS which indicated that the applicant was "cooperative and forthcoming" and a security memorandum dated July 26, 2001, which states that "His [the applicant's] history, first with the APMSO [All Pakistan Mohajir Student Organization] and later with the MQM in Pakistan, indicates that he is very involved with the cause of the Mohajirs, however, nothing indicates he has personally been involved in violent or terrorist activities". I note firstly, that the applicant's cooperative and forthcoming behaviour, while laudable is irrelevant to the present matter before this Court. Second, as stated by my colleague Justice Pierre Blais in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2007] F.C.J. No. 642 (QL), at para. 11 "[...] the issue of complicity is irrelevant to a determination under paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Act, which refers strictly to the notion of membership in the organization."
[21]
Accordingly, I am unable to conclude that the officer's analysis with respect to the second step was unreasonable. To the contrary, the "decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , above, at para. 47).
[22]
For the preceding reasons, this application for judicial review shall be dismissed.
