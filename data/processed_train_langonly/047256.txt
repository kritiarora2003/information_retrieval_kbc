<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.F.), 42 A.C.W.S. (3d) 886).
[8]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for judicial review under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, R.S., 2001, c. 27, of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (panel) dated September 22, 2008, which found that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.
[2]
For the following reasons the application for judicial review will be allowed.
[3]
The Court is satisfied with the explanations given by the applicant in order to seek an extension of time to file his application for leave and judicial review. In fact, it was due to his illness and inability to contact his attorney that the application was filed late.
[4]
The applicant's claim for refugee protection was rejected by the panel because his story was not deemed credible and because the panel was not convinced there was a lack of state protection by the Mexican authorities.
[5]
In this case the applicant is a journalist who fears returning to his home country as he had witnessed the transport of children's corpses and had deduced that it was linked to organ trafficking. He was subsequently threatened and was involved in a car accident in which some members of his family were injured. Experts would later conclude that his car's brake lines had been severed.
Standard of review
[6]
The respondent maintains that the applicable standard of review regarding the panel's lack of credibility finding is that of unreasonableness (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 893 (QL)).
[7]
When considering matters of credibility and weighing of evidence, it is well established under subsection 18.1(4)(
) of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C., 1985, c. F-7, that the Court will only intervene if the decision is based on an erroneous finding of fact, made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), 42 A.C.W.S. (3d) 886).
[8]
Assessing credibility and weighing of evidence fall under the jurisdiction of the administrative panel, which must take the claimant's subjective fear of persecution into account (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the applicable standard of review in similar circumstances was patent unreasonableness. Since then, it is reasonableness.
[9]
The appropriate standard of review in matters of state protection is reasonableness (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 392 at paragraphs 9 to 11;
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  F.T.R. 150 at paragraph 14 and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2008] F.C.J. No. 908 (QL) at paragraph 3).
[10]
In this case, the panel considered only highly selective facts in the applicant's narrative. Nonetheless, the applicant's PIF contains several significant facts which were omitted and not taken into consideration by the panel.
[11]
Furthermore, the panel twice mentions: '' ... There is certainly nothing in the documentary evidence to indicate that journalists in Mexico are at such risk that they are murdered and that no state protection is available to them.'' (paragraph 10 of the decision). In fact there are documents in Mexico's National Documentation Package which suggest the very opposite. These documents were neither mentioned nor considered by the panel, yet this evidence was at the very heart of the claim.
[12]
The panel should have considered all of the evidence, especially the documentary evidence which might have allowed them to conclude that the facts described by the applicant regarding his fear of persecution and the lack of state protection were true.
[13]
While one assumes that a panel has examined all of the evidence, where there exists significant evidence which contradicts the panel's findings, it must provide reasons to explain why this evidence is deemed to be neither relevant nor reliable (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  [2006] F.C.J. No. 1224 (QL) at paragraph 44).
[14]
No questions for certification arise from this matter.
THE COURT ORDERS that
the application for judicial review be allowed. The matter is referred for reconsideration by a newly constituted panel.
