Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application for judicial review of a report (the "Report") made by the Security Intelligence Review Committee (the "Review Committee") to the Governor-in-Council, pursuant to s. 39 of the
Immigration Act
[see footnote 1] (the "
"), wherein the Review Committee concluded that a certificate should be issued in respect of Mr. Al Yamani (the "applicant") in accordance with s. 40(1) of the
. The Report is dated the 17th of April, 1998. The investigation conducted by the Review Committee and giving rise to the Report was triggered by a report to the Review Committee by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Solicitor General of Canada expressing their opinion, based on security or criminal intelligence reports received and considered by them, that the applicant is a person described in paragraphs 19(1)(e) and (g) and paragraph 27(1)(c) of the
. The relevant portions of ss. 19(1) and 27(1), and ss. 38.1 and 39 of the
, as they read at the relevant time for the purposes of this judicial review, are set out in the Schedule to these reasons.
[2]
The Report has significant implications for the applicant and the members of his family. The Governor-in-Council accepted the recommendation of the Review Committee and directed the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to issue a certificate. The Minister has acted in accordance with that direction. In the result, the applicant is at risk of losing, the qualified right he had to remain in Canada.
[3]
The Report is the second such report by the Review Committee to the Governor-in-Council in respect of the applicant. The first such report was set aside and referred back to the Review Committee by decision of this court [see footnote 2] on the grounds that:
"... paragraph 19(1)(g), insofar as it relates to 'persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe ... are members of ... an organization that is likely to engage in ... acts' ('of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada'), contravenes paragraph 2(d) of the
Charter
which ensures, to everyone, freedom of association. I find it is not established that this limit freedom under the impugned portion of the paragraph in issue is a reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. I note that this determination does not relate to other classes of persons described in paragraph 19(1)(g) of the
The applicant is a stateless Palestinian in his mid-forties. Although he was born in Lebanon and describes Lebanon as his former country of habitual residence, he expresses concern that he might not be able to return there. He has been a permanent resident of Canada since April of 1985 and has lived here since that time. He lives together with his wife and two sons. His wife has no permanent status in Canada pending determination of the status of the applicant. The applicant's two sons are Canadian citizens.
[5]
The applicant attests that he has never been charged with or convicted of any criminal offence.
[6]
The applicant graduated from York University in 1995 and has, since that time, been gainfully employed.
[7]
The applicant was, for many years until in or about 1992, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (the "PFLP"). He remains an active supporter of the Palestinian cause. While in Canada, and while still a member of the PFLP, he engaged in the receipt and disbursement of very significant amounts of money on behalf of the PFLP, facilitated communications to PFLP members in North America, facilitated travel of PFLP members and was otherwise active in PFLP affairs in North America.
THE REVIEW COMMITTEE REPORT
[8]
Before the Review Committee, counsel for the applicant raised issues regarding the constitutional applicability and validity of paragraphs 19(1)(e) and (g) of the
in the light of provisions of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[see footnote 3] (the "
Charter
"). The Review Committee declined to deal with the constitutional issues. It wrote:
"After carefully reviewing the composition of the Committee and its functions, I come to the conclusion that the Committee is not a court of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of s. 24 of the
Charter
and that it does not have the jurisdiction to decide the constitutional issues raised by Mr. Yamani. Although the Committee clearly has jurisdiction over the parties and over the subject matter, it does not have jurisdiction over the remedy. The Committee has no decisive authority in relation to the issuance of the certificate sought. The decision to issue the certificate lies only with the Governor-in-Council. Therefore, I will not decide on the matters brought up by the constitutional issues."
[9]
The same constitutional issues were raised before me and it was not in dispute that this court has the jurisdiction to deal with them [see footnote 4].
[10]
Under the heading "Grounds on which the Committee's conclusion is based", the Committee wrote:
"Without oversimplifying the mandate of the Committee in this investigation, I did ask Mr. Yamani what he saw as the most difficult task presented to me as the Chair of the investigation into the Ministerial report concerning him. I find his answer very interesting. His answer was: 'to believe me or not to believe me'.
"In the midst of the hearing part of the investigation, when examined by the Committee's Counsel, Mr. Yamani explained how, at the time of the first Committee hearing, he had been afraid to admit his membership in the PFLP.
"He now admitted to being active 'in and out'; qualifying that he was the weakest person in North America because he was in Canada, and Canada was irrelevant to the PFLP. Mr. Yamani detailed how he was born and raised to a nationalistic Palestinian family [his father was one of the founders of the PFLP] who did not do politics but were politics.
"At the last [first] hearing, Committee Counsel had questioned Mr. Yamani as to whether he (Mr. Yamani) would describe himself as the closest person in Canada to the leadership of the PFLP. Mr. Yamani had answered yes ...
. . . . .
"According to Mr. Yamani, he would no longer consider himself the closest person to the PFLP leadership and to Dr. Habash in Canada. He says that, since 1991, he is no longer in contact with any of the PFLP leaders. The last social or political 'PFLP related event' he attended was in February 1993 in Damascus for the resignation of his father."
[11]
The Review Committee made the following findings: the applicant was tasked with handling the transfer of large sums of money for the PFLP into the Israeli occupied territories. This tasking is strongly suggestive of his being a person in a position of trust and particular importance to the PFLP; the applicant facilitated the travel of persons for military training; the applicant agreed to deliver PFLP documents, believed to have been applications for membership in the PFLP, to the Middle-East; the applicant, up until 1990, assisted with the accumulation of materials and documents which would facilitate the production of false travel documents for members of the PFLP; in 1977, while he was head of the PFLP in Abu Dhabi, the applicant was "involved" in a bomb attack on an Air Egypt office in the United Arab Emirates; the PFLP is a long-standing member of the Palestine Liberation Organization and itself has "... an international reputation as a particularly ruthless terrorist group"; despite the peace process that is unfolding between Israel and the Palestine Authority, the objective of the PFLP has not changed since the Ministerial Report; and the applicant admits only to what he believes is known or can no longer be held against him and demonstrated a lack of transparency essential to convey a sense of truthfulness.
[12]
The Review Committee concluded as follows:
"After carefully considering all of the documentary evidence and the testimony given before me on a balance of probabilities,
I conclude that Mr. Yamani has engaged in acts of subversion
by assisting and facilitating the objective of the PFLP. By virtue of his resort to counter-surveillance tactics and code words, his actions in transferring PFLP funds, involving himself in facilitating the travel of persons for PFLP military training, and establishing cells, Mr. Yamani must be seen as someone who, through his efforts to further the PFLP's objective, has participated in the subversive acts of the PFLP.
"Quite apart from his activity in participating in the subversive acts of the PFLP, I cannot ignore evidence of Mr. Yamani's participation in the 1977 bombing of the Air Egypt office in the United Arab Emirates. While this incident may have been unrealistic and futile in terms of what it actually accomplished, the intention behind the bombing being to signal displeasure with Egypt's peace overtures towards Israel. This incident, like other terrorist acts committed by the PFLP in furtherance of subversion, was intended to draw attention to the plight of the Palestinian people and to isolate Israel and the nations that evidenced a willingness to compromise the goal of an independent Palestinian state, all with the aim of contributing, however indirectly and ineffectively, to the overthrow of the State of Israel. Seen in this light, the Air Egypt bombing can be seen as a terrorist, subversive act directed against the State of Israel, which Canada recognizes as a democracy.
. . . . .
"I relied on the tests set out in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  evidence is whether there are reasonable grounds for such a belief, rather than the existence of the fact itself, it seems to me that to require proof of the fact itself and proceed to determine whether it has been established is to demand the proof of a different fact from that required to be ascertained. It seems to me that the use by the statute of the expression "reasonable grounds for believing" implies that the fact itself [need] not be established and that evidence which falls short of proving the subversive character of the organization [will be sufficient if it is enough to show reasonable grounds for believing that the organization] is one that advocates subversion by force, ...'
"Terrorism has been employed as a tactic of subversive organizations, such as the PFLP. I cannot ignore this fact. There is no reason to believe that the PFLP is any less dedicated to its goals and would be any less willing to engage in terrorist actions in Canada, if that was perceived to be required to allow it to achieve its goals. I conclude, therefore, that there is still a possibility that the PFLP may commit acts of violence in Canada.
"Allowing Mr. Yamani to remain in Canada could provide logistical support for such acts of violence in Canada. I note that Mr. Yamani was assigned his tasks as a communications link and was a travel facilitator for all PFLP activities in North America by PFLP Headquarters in the Middle East because of his location in Canada.
"Based on all the evidence before me, I conclude that Mr. Yamani only makes admissions when he believes that those admissions cannot be used against him, or when he is confronted with a certain level of knowledge on the part of the Service. Given his demonstrated commitment to the 'PFLP cause' and his leadership position,
I conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Yamani is likely ('susceptible') to participate in the unlawful activities of the PFLP, if called upon to do so.
I conclude that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he will engage in acts of subversion against democratic government, institutions or processes, as they are understood in Canada.
"Having found that Mr. Yamani is a person described in paragraphs 19(1)(e) and 19(1)(g), I conclude that a certificate should be issued in accordance with s. 40(1) of the
Immigration Act
." (citations omitted, emphasis added, some errors in the quotation corrected)
[13]
In reaching its conclusions, the Review Committee relies on a commentary on "subversion", referred to by the Review Committee as a "definition" of "subversion", provided by Mr. Justice Cullen in Shandi, Re [see footnote 5] where he wrote at paragraph 17:
"Espionage and subversion are not limited to the actual act but to be engaged in these activities the words envisage participation by one who assists or facilitates the objective as one who commits the actus reus.
Any act that is intended to contribute to the process of overthrowing a government is a subversive act
. It perplexes me that so much has been written about subversion, or that the word should not be used because it runs contrary to a person's rights under the
Charter
to be a dissident. Certainly CSIS investigators must be aware of the difference (which may not always have been the case), but subversive acts are not difficult to distinguish from acts of protest that should not be subject to investigations. For example, if funds are raised or guns sent to the IRA from Canada, is that not clearly subversion? However, vocal comment or written treaties on the 'Struggle' are clearly protected under the
Charter
. Examples of subversive acts are not difficult to find." (emphasis added)
THE ISSUES
[14]
In the applicant's Memorandum of Fact and Law in support of the application for leave to commence this judicial review application, the following issues are identified:
-	whether the Review Committee erred in law in determining that it did not have jurisdiction to consider and rule on constitutional challenges to the validity of the legislation it is otherwise required to apply;
-	whether the Review Committee erred in law in its interpretation of terms that it applied without considering the constitutional validity of such terms, those terms including "subversion", "democratic government ... as understood in Canada" and "reasonable grounds to believe"; and
-	whether the Review Committee ignored evidence or misinterpreted evidence such that it erred in law and whether these errors led the Review Committee to reach unreasonable conclusions.
[15]
The first issue was not pursued at the hearing before me in light of the fact that the constitutional challenges were argued de novo before me within the context of the second issue.
[16]
The second issue identified comprehends questions of whether or not interpretations adopted by the Review Committee infringe the applicant's rights to freedom of expression and association as enshrined in s. 2 of the
Charter
and violate his equality rights under s. 15 of the
Charter
. Further, the second issue encompasses an argument that paragraphs 19(1)(e) and 19(1(g) of the
incorporate terms that are unconstitutionally vague with the result that those paragraphs should be held to be of no force or effect.
[17]
A notice of constitutional question was served on the attorneys general of the provinces and territories and of Canada on the 12th of August, 1999. In the notice, the legal basis of the constitutional questions is described in the following terms:
"1. 'Subversion' in ss. 19(1)(e) and 27(1)(c) of the
Immigration Act
is of no force and effect under s. 52(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1982
. It is vague and not capable of being given a consistent and settled meaning and as such is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
. It lacks definitional boundaries, and is overly broad, resulting in an infringement of s. 2 Freedoms and s. 15 Equality Rights under the
Charter
.
"2. 'Democratic government, institutions and processes' in s. 19(1)(e) of the
Immigration Act
is of no force and effect under s. 52(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1982
. It is vague and not capable of being given a consistent and settled meaning and as such in inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
. It lacks definitional boundaries, and is overly broad.
"3. 'Reasonable grounds to believe' in ss. 19(1)(e) and (g) of the
Immigration Act
establishes an 'illusory' standard of defence, inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
The Review Committee recommendation did not extend to paragraph 27(1)(c) of the
with the result that it was acknowledged before me that this judicial review application could not properly extend to issues surrounding that paragraph.
[19]
During the course of the hearing of this matter, the further issue of the standard of review of the decision of the Review Committee was identified.
Standard of Review
[20]
Counsel were in agreement that the standard of review with regard to the issue of ignoring or misinterpreting of evidence resulting in unreasonable conclusions on the part of the Review Committee is "reasonableness simpliciter". In support of this position, counsel cited
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  counsel were in agreement that the standard of review is "correctness". I am in agreement with the position of counsel on both aspects of the issue, standard of review.
The applicant submitted that the word "subversion", the phrase "democratic government, institutions or processes ... as they are understood in Canada" as used in paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
, and the phrase "reasonable grounds to believe" as it is used in both paragraphs 19(1)(e) and (g) of the
, should be found to be of no force and effect as they are void for vagueness. Counsel urged that if I were to find any of the impugned word and phrases to be void for vagueness, the decision of the Review Committee should be struck down by virtue of its reliance on the impugned word or phrase.
[22]
For ease of reference, the relevant portions of s. 19(1) of the
are repeated here:
"19. (1) No person shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:
. . . . .
(e) persons who have engaged in or there are reasonable grounds to believe will engage in acts of espionage or subversion against democratic government, institutions or processes, as they are understood in Canada, except persons who, having engaged in such acts, have satisfied the Minister that their admission would not be detrimental to the national interest;
. . . . .
(g) persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe will engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada or are members of or are likely to participate in the unlawful activities of an organization that is likely to engage in such acts of violence; ..."
The doctrine of vagueness was clearly and extensively articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Mr. Justice Gonthier reviewed the case law of the court on vagueness in the context of the
Charter
and, commencing at p. 626 of the reported decision, wrote:
"The foregoing may be summarized by way of the following propositions:
"1. Vagueness can be raised under s. 7 of the
Charter
, since it is a principle of fundamental justice that laws may not be too vague. It can also be raised under s. 1 of the
Charter
in limine, on the basis that an enactment is so vague as not to satisfy the requirement that a limitation on
Charter
rights be 'prescribed by law'. Furthermore, vagueness is also relevant to the 'minimal impairment' stage of the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test ...
"2. The 'doctrine of vagueness' is founded on the rule of law, particularly on the principles of fair notice to citizens and limitation of enforcement discretion ...
"3. Factors to be considered in determining whether a law is too vague include (a) the need for flexibility and the interpretative role of the courts, (b) the impossibility of achieving absolute certainty, a standard of intelligibility being more appropriate and (c) the possibility that many varying judicial interpretations of a given disposition may exist and perhaps coexist ...
"4. Vagueness, when raised under s. 7 or under s. 1 'in limine', involves similar considerations ... On the other hand, vagueness as it relates to the 'minimal impairment' branch of s. 1 merges with the related concept of overbreadth ...
"5. The court will be reluctant to find a disposition so vague as not to qualify as 'law' under s. 1 'in limine', and will rather consider the scope of the disposition under the minimal impairment test ..." (citations omitted)
[24]
After noting at p. 632 that "... the threshold for finding a law vague is relatively high.", Gonthier, J., wrote at p. 643 that "... a law will be found unconstitutionally vague if it so lacks in precision as not to give sufficient guidance for legal debate". The court's rationale for this conclusion was in the following terms at pp. 639 and 640 [S.C.R.]:
"A vague provision does not provide an adequate basis for legal debate, that is for reaching a conclusion as to its meaning by reasoned analysis applying legal criteria. It does not sufficiently delineate any area of risk, and thus can provide neither fair notice to the citizen nor a limitation of enforcement discretion. Such a provision is not intelligible, to use the terminology of previous decisions of this court, and therefore it fails to give sufficient indications that could fuel a legal debate. It offers no grasp to the judiciary. This is an exacting standard, going beyond semantics. The term 'legal debate' is used here not to express a new standard or one departing from that previously outlined by this court. It is rather intended to reflect and encompass the same standard and criteria of fair notice and limitation of enforcement discretion viewed in the fuller context of an analysis of the quality and limits of human knowledge and understanding in the operation of the law."
[25]
Mr. Justice Gonthier continued at p. 642 [S.C.R.]:
"... The modern State intervenes today in fields where some generality in the enactment is inevitable. The substance of these enactments remains nonetheless intelligible.
One must be wary of using the doctrine of vagueness to prevent or impede State action in furtherance of valid social objectives, by requiring the law to achieve a degree of precision to which the subject-matter does not lend itself. A delicate balance must be maintained between societal interests and individual rights
. A measure of generality also sometimes allows for greater respect for fundamental rights, since circumstances that would not justify the invalidation of a more precise enactment may be accommodated through the application of a more general one.
"What becomes more problematic is not so much general terms conferring broad discretion, but terms failing to give direction as to how to exercise this discretion, so that this exercise may be controlled. Once more, an unpermissibly vague law will not provide a sufficient basis for legal debate; it will not give a sufficient indication as to how decisions must be reached, such as factors to be considered or determinative elements. In giving unfettered discretion, it will deprive the judiciary of means of controlling the exercise of this discretion." (emphasis added)
[26]
Gonthier, J., expressly stated at p. 642 [S.C.R.] that the doctrine of vagueness "... applies to all enactments, irrespective of whether they are civil, criminal, administrative or other".
[27]
As noted earlier, Gonthier, J., also stated that the doctrine of vagueness imposes a high threshold. This is evidenced by the fact that it has only been invoked on one occasion by the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  interest" criterion within paragraph 515(10)(b) of the
Criminal Code of Canada
[see footnote 11], which permitted the detention of an accused on the ground that it was necessary "... in the public interest or for the protection or safety of the public ...", was "... too vague and imprecise ..." under paragraph 11(e) of the
Charter
such that it was unconstitutional.
[28]
While Lamer, C.J., acknowledged at pp. 729-730 [S.C.R.] that:
"A provision does not violate the doctrine of vagueness simply because it is subject to interpretation. To require absolute precision would be to create an impossible constitutional standard. ...
. . . . .
"It seems apparent that, at the very least, the term 'public interest' is subject to interpretation. It accordingly becomes necessary to determine whether it is capable of being given a constant and settled meaning by the courts."
[29]
After canvassing the ongoing legal debate as to whether a workable meaning had been found for the term "public interest", he concluded at p. 732 [S.C.R.]:
"As currently defined by the courts, the term 'public interest' is incapable of framing the legal debate in a meaningful manner or structuring discretion in any way.
"Nor would it be possible in my view to give the term 'public interest' a constant or settled meaning. The term gives the courts unrestricted latitude to define any circumstances as sufficient to justify pretrial detention. The term creates no criteria to define these circumstances. No amount of judicial interpretation of the term 'public interest' would be capable of rendering it a provision which gives any guidance for legal debate."
[30]
Lamer, C.J., went on to hold that the vague provision could not be saved under s. 1 of the
Charter
. He did, however, at p. 740, find the "... public safety component of s. 515(10)(b) ..." of the
to be constitutionally valid since it "... establishes narrow circumstances in which bail is denied. Those circumstances are necessary to promote the proper functioning of the bail system and are not undertaken for any purpose extraneous to the bail system".
[31]
It is worthy of note that Gonthier, J., and L'Heureux-Dubé, J., dissented from the majority's finding  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  that the phrase "public interest" was unconstitutionally vague.
"Subversion"
[32]
"Subversion", I am satisfied, is an extraordinarily elusive concept.
[33]
In undertaking a vagueness analysis, it is well established that a court must first develop the full interpretive context surrounding an impugned provision in order to determine whether the provision provides a sufficient basis for distinguishing between permissible and impermissible conduct, or for ascertaining an "area of risk". The factors to be considered in applying a contextual approach were outlined by Mr. Justice Gonthier in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  debate is possible, a court must first engage in the interpretive process which is inherent to the 'mediating role' of the judiciary ... . Vagueness must not be considered in abstracto, but instead must be assessed within a larger interpretive context developed through an analysis of considerations such as the purpose, subject matter and nature of the impugned provision, societal values, related legislative provisions, and prior judicial interpretations of the provision. Only after exhausting its interpretive role will a court then be in a position to determine whether an impugned provision affords sufficient guidance for legal debate." (citation omitted)
[34]
The starting point, therefore, for determining whether a provision provides an adequate basis for legal debate, and consequently, for arriving at a conclusion as to its meaning by reasoned analysis, is the statute itself in which the impugned provision appears.
[35]
The
Immigration Act
neither expressly defines nor sets out any criteria by which to gauge the meaning of the term "subversion". The language of paragraph 19(1)(e) is very broad; not only does it contemplate activities taking place within Canada but aimed towards the undermining of foreign countries, but it also captures both violent and non-violent acts of espionage and subversion. One thing is clear from the terminology of paragraph 19(1)(e): it employs the words "espionage" and "subversion" disjunctively. Thus, whatever "subversion" is intended to mean, it is not intended to encompass "espionage".
[36]
The absence of statutory definition necessitates a consideration of the underlying objectives of the
Immigration Act
. Of particular relevance is paragraph 3(j), which provides:
"3. It is hereby declared that Canadian immigration policy and the rules and regulations made under this Act shall be designed and administered in such a manner as to promote the domestic and international interests of Canada recognizing the need
. . . . .
(j) to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canadian territory to persons who are likely to engage in
." (emphasis added)
[37]
This declaration is strengthened and amplified by the declaration of purpose reflected in s. 38.1 of the
that is quoted in the Schedule to these reasons.
[38]
It is therefore evident that the policy and purpose behind the exclusion from Canada pursuant to paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
of persons who either have engaged in or who may engage in espionage or subversion is to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canada as a base for espionage or subversion or, in the words of paragraph 3(j), for "criminal activity", an expression that is clearly not coextensive with espionage and subversion.
[39]
That the inadmissibility terms of paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
are inextricably linked to national security interests is no surprise. Indeed, the
Immigration Act
expressly refers to the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
[see footnote 13] and empowers the Review Committee to investigate the grounds of a report made by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Solicitor General of Canada stating the opinion that, based on security or intelligence reports received and considered by them, a permanent resident is described within one or more of the inadmissible classes. [see footnote 14]
[40]
Given the absence of a definition of "subversion" within the
Immigration Act
and its failure to set out any factors or determinative elements for identifying the parameters of activities falling within the scope of "subversion", I turn to the related provisions of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
for guidance. [see footnote 15]
[41]
It is interesting to note that the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
simply does not use the term "subversion". Paragraph (d) of the definition "threats to the security of Canada" in s. 2 of that
[see footnote 16] is apparently as close as the
gets to a concept of subversion. Further, that paragraph, as with all elements of the definition, is specifically limited to exclude lawful advocacy, protest or dissent unless the advocacy, protest or dissent is carried on in conjunction with the activities referred to in the elements of the definition.
[42]
In its report, the Special Committee of the House of Commons on the Review of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
and the
Security Offences Act
[see footnote 17] stated that two types of activity are included in paragraph (d) of the definition "threats to the security of Canada". The Special Committee indicated that paragraph (d) covered activities that were either:
"1) directed toward undermining by covert unlawful acts the constitutionally established system of government
; or
"2) directed toward or intended ultimately to lead to the destruction or overthrow by violence of the constitutionally established system of government
." (emphasis added)
[43]
The Special Committee recommended the repeal of paragraph (d) on the basis that many of the activities that it encompassed could be dealt with under paragraphs (a) "espionage and sabotage ...", (b) "foreign influenced activities ..." and (c) "politically motivated violence" of the definition. In reaching this conclusion, the Special Committee noted that paragraph 2(d) was by far the most controversial provision that it had addressed and outlined briefly both sides of the argument as follows:
"Those who call for the repeal of paragraph (d) see it as having a chilling effect on rights and freedoms. They argue that the vagueness of this provision leads to excessive speculation on the ultimate effect of the exercise of guaranteed rights and freedoms and, consequently, to uncalled-for targeting of legitimate activity. They also say that since the Counter-subversion Branch of CSIS was disbanded in 1987, it is now time to repeal paragraph (d) of the definition of threats to the security of Canada as a spent provision.
"Those who argue in favour of retaining paragraph (d) admit that the activities it covers do not constitute a major threat to the security of Canada at present and that many of the activities it encompasses may be captured by paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition. But they go on to argue that Canadians expect CSIS to be in a position to forwarn the Government of Canada about potential threats to the security of Canada, especially if the activities dealt with by paragraph (d) again become a significant threat at some future time." [see footnote 18]
[44]
Given the close relationship between the
Immigration Act
and the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
in terms of national security issues, it is perhaps surprising that the "threats" provisions in s. 2 of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
differ so markedly from the related criteria for denying admission to Canada in the
Immigration Act
, particularly since the McDonald Commission [see footnote 19], the Review Committee [see footnote 20] and the Special Committee on the Review of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
[see footnote 21] and the
Security Offences Act
recommended that these criteria be consistent.
[45]
In contrast to paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
Immigration Act
, the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
confines the concept of "subversion" to acts directed toward either the undermining by covert unlawful acts or the overthrow by violence of the constitutionally established system of government
. It therefore is much more specific or focussed than the concept "subversion" in the
Immigration Act
in that it requires acts to be directed at the Canadian system of government, and to be either covert and unlawful or violent.
[46]
The uncertainty surrounding any attempt to distinguish between permissible and impermissible conduct in relation to "subversion" is compounded when one considers the broad definition of "subversive or hostile activities" found in s. 15(2) of the
Access to Information Act
. [see footnote 22] The relevant portion of that provision reads:
"(2) In this section,
. . . . .
'subversive or hostile activities' means
(a) espionage against Canada or any state allied or associated with Canada,
(c) activities directed toward the commission of terrorist acts, including hijacking, in or against Canada or foreign states,
(d) activities directed toward accomplishing government change within Canada or foreign states by the use of or the encouragement of the use of force, violence or any criminal means,
(e) activities directed toward gathering information used for intelligence purposes that relates to Canada or any state allied or associated with Canada, and
(f) activities directed toward threatening the safety of Canadians, employees of the Government of Canada or property of the Government of Canada outside Canada."
The foregoing definition would appear to contemplate "subversive activities" which may or may not involve violence and that target Canada or any state allied or associated with Canada. It does not distinguish between activities which would be considered subversive as opposed to hostile; rather, it lumps together a broad mix of activities ranging from intelligence gathering to terrorism.
[48]
Given the ambiguity and lack of determinative elements regarding the term subversion in the
Immigration Act
, it is perhaps surprising that the term has been rarely judicially considered. In fact, Mr. Justice Cullen appears to be alone in his attempt to give meaning to the term. In
[see footnote 23] in the context of a judicial review of the validity of a certificate issued pursuant to s. 40.1(4) of the
Immigration Act
, Mr. Justice Cullen, as noted earlier in these reasons, wrote:
"Espionage and subversion are not limited to the actual act but to be engaged in these activities the words envisage participation by one who assists or facilitates the objective as one who commits the actus reus.
Any act that is intended to contribute to the process of overthrowing a government is a subversive act
. It perplexes me that so much has been written about subversion, or that the word should not be used because it runs contrary to a person's rights under the
Charter
to be a dissident. Certainly CSIS investigators must be aware of the difference (which may not always have been the case), but subversive acts are not difficult to distinguish from acts of protest that should not be subject to investigations. For example, if funds are raised or guns sent to the I.R.A. from Canada, is that not clearly subversion? However, vocal comment or written treaties on the 'Struggle' are clearly protected under the
Charter
. Examples of subversive acts are difficult to find." (emphasis added)
[49]
Mr. Justice Cullen's terminology would appear to be remarkably broad. The highlighted sentence involves no concept of covertness, violence or unlawfulness; rather, it would appear to encompass open, non-violent, lawful activities of legitimate political opposition parties, albeit that this breadth would appear to be qualified somewhat later in the quoted paragraph. In the end, Justice Cullen appears to be saying, we will know subversion when we see it. In this, he appears to draw support from reputable dictionaries.
[50]
The
Oxford English Dictionary
, second edition, [see footnote 24] defines "subversion" as including "the action of subverting or state of being subverted":
"1. Overthrow, demolition (of a city, stronghold etc.)
. . . . .
"4. In immaterial senses: Overthrow, ruin.
a. of a law, rule, system, condition, faculty, character, etc.
b. of persons, countries, peoples, or their lives or fortunes."
[51]
The
ITP Nelson Canadian Dictionary of the English Language
[see footnote 25] provides the following relevant definitions:
"'subversion': 1.a. The act or an instance of subverting. b. The condition of being subverted. 2. A cause of overthrow or ruin.
"'subversive': Intended or serving to subvert, esp. intended to overthrow or undermine an established government.
"'subvert': 1. To destroy completely; ruin. 2. To undermine the character, morals, or allegiance of; corrupt. 3. To overthrow completely."
Black's Law Dictionary
, seventh edition, [see footnote 26] provides:
"'Subversion': The process of overthrowing, destroying, or corrupting.
"'Subversive activity': A pattern of acts designed to overthrow a government by force or other illegal means."
[52]
While Mr. Justice Cullen's definition and the dictionary definitions of "subversion" and related terms are helpful in providing a general understanding of the concept, they do not clarify its legal parameters. In particular, they do not aid in distinguishing between subversion and lawful dissent, nor do they provide guidance to define the boundary between the two. They provide no basis or guidance for legal debate.
[53]
Indeed, the fluidity of the term or concept was affirmed by Professor Reg Whitaker, who was the only expert witness to testify before the Review Committee on the historical application of the concept of subversion in Canada. The following is extracted from his evidence [see footnote 27]:
"Q.	... First of all, if it is possible, can you explain what your understanding would be of the concept of subversion?
A.	One would have to make some distinctions here because it is a very fluid concept, to put it mildly.
The first distinction to be made would be between what one might call popular understanding of the term and the legal understanding of the term.
In terms of the popular understanding of the term, I suppose that one could best understand it within the context of the Cold War from the 1940s through to the 1980s. The popular notion, which was also one that was certainly held by governments, I think, in that period, was that there was a threat to security which was allied to an external power, the Soviet Bloc, international communism, but which was manifested from within, and involved the clandestine, deceptive, covert undermining of the institutions of Canadian Government by a kind of fifth column allied to this external enemy or this external threat.
The crucial elements there are "undermining from within" and "in a clandestine" or deceptive fashion". So, you had the notion of, for example, activities that were carried on by front groups which allegedly concealed their aims and sought to covertly achieve an undermining of the fabric of Canadian democracy without, in fact, being open about it.
. . . . .
In terms of the legal definition, we are on even shakier ground. There is, in fact, no clear legal definition of which I am aware in Canadian law, although the term is used occasionally. I suppose the closest one can come to a definition is in Section 2(d) of the CSIS Act, ... although the term 'subversion' is not used, ...
. . . . .
That definition has been an extremely controversial one, which has probably had more criticism directed against it than any other part, to my knowledge, of the CSIS Act.
. . . . .
Q.	... You identified covert activity from within a government, from within a country. Does it necessarily include violence?
A.	That is one of the problems with the concept. Perhaps going back over it, both in terms of the popular and the legal conception of subversion, it seems to me that the crucial difficulty is that every attempt to specify what is involved in subversion tends to either disappear into other clearly specified kinds of threats, such as espionage, such as foreign influence to activities in Canada as terrorism, sabotage or what one might call revolutionary violence, that is actual overt attempts to overthrow government by violent means.
Subversion seems to disappear into one or other of those categories, which are all caught under different definitions already in various areas or – and this is why it has been so controversial – it tends to disappear into what one might call the very contentious area of lawful advocacy, protest and dissent, i.e., views that are considered to be dissenting, radical, out of the pale of orthodoxy at a particular time.
. . . . .
Q.	How would you characterize attempts to overthrow a government from outside that government?
A.	There is a fairly well established set of notions about that. We have military force war and a government is overthrown by a foreign government's military force. One form or other of military aggression would seem to cover that.
There might be individual acts that might be taken in a different context. Short of that, such as a terrorist act, for example, directed from abroad, which would be clearly seen as terrorism or something like foreign-directed sabotage, might be seen in that light. Again, a fairly clear definition there, I would think."
[54]
Professor Whitaker also testified about the term "subversion" in relation to the Palestinian movement and the activities of the PFLP within that movement [see footnote 28]:
"... The point about subversion is that it must imply, if it implies anything at all, a covert or clandestine threat from within.
It has always, even in both the popular and in whatever one can make of the legal definition here, involved those two elements, both the clandestine element or the deceptive element, but also that undermining from within.
In the case of whether Palestinian political activities directed against Israel, whether they took the form of terrorist actions in the early phase or whether they take the form of actions carried out against what are perceived to be military targets, or even in the case of actions undertaken within the Occupied Territories in which Israel appears in the form of a military conqueror and has established a military occupation of those territories, and I think that puts a very different framework on whatever actions take place within that context, none of those can one reasonably describe such activities as undermining from within.
It is precisely because the Palestinians have been excluded by the State of Israel, both physically and formally in terms of Israeli citizenship, et cetera, et cetera, that those activities are directed, in effect, from the outside in, not from the inside, I would say quite clearly that I cannot even comprehend how the term 'subversion' would make any sense in relation to that." (emphasis added)
He continued at pp. 1560-1561 of the Transcript:
"Q.	... In your mind or in your opinion, can the PFLP commit subversive activities in relation to the State of Israel?
A.	No, I would be quite categorical about that. This is not to say that the PFLP might not commit acts of violence, of terrorism, or that they have not in the past carried out such acts. But subversion, however difficult it might be to get a hold of that concept in its entirety in the Canadian context, seems to me to clearly and decisively not apply to the case of the Palestinians who are not situated in a position where they could, even if they were to choose such a strategy, to undermine clandestinely from within.
The PFLP is an organization which is clearly external of the State of Israel and has no capacity to carry out anything that might be referred to under the minimal definition that I can find of subversion as clandestinely undermining from within.
As I say, that is not to say acts of violence, terrorism and so on, but those are directed from without, not from within."
"Subversion" - Void for Vagueness?
[55]
For the concept of unconstitutional vagueness to be engaged, a provision of the
Charter
Counsel for the applicant urged that s. 7 of the
Charter
, among other provisions, is engaged. Section 7 reads as follows:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  certificating process under the
Immigration Act
. At pp. 318 and 319, Mr. Justice Pratte wrote:
"Did, however, the filing of the s. 83 certificate affect the appellant's right to life, liberty and security of the person? The filing of the certificate had the effect of depriving the Immigration Appeal Board of its power to allow the appellant's appeal on compassionate grounds. This, in itself, did not directly interfere with the appellant's right to life, liberty and security of the person. However, if things are looked at realistically, it cannot be denied that, as a result of the filing of the certificate, the appellant will be deported to Italy while he otherwise might have been allowed to remain in the country. As, in my view, deportation necessarily implies an interference with the liberty of the person, I would say that a violation of s. 7 of the
Charter
has been established.
"The next question is whether that violation was authorized by s. 1 of the
Charter
. In other words, was the limitation that was imposed on the right of the appellant to know the allegations made against him reasonable? Was it prescribed by law and demonstrably justified in a democratic society?"
[58]
The issue before the court in this matter is not the issuance or filing of a certificate but rather a recommendation by the Review Committee to the Governor-in-Council that a certificate should be issued in accordance with s. 40(1) of the
Immigration Act
. At the time this matter was heard, it was known that that recommendation had been accepted and that a certificate had in fact issued. In the words of Mr. Justice Pratte, "... looked at realistically, it cannot be denied that, as a result of the [Review Committee report], the [applicant] will be deported ..." although the destination to which he will be deported apparently remains uncertain.
[59]
I adopt the view of Mr. Justice Pratte that, on the facts of this matter, "... deportation necessarily implies an interference with the liberty of the [applicant] ...". [see footnote 30] Parenthetically, though perhaps not relevant for the purposes of determining whether or not s. 7 is engaged, the impact of deportation of the applicant on his wife and his children is potentially dramatic.
[60]
Counsel for the respondent urged that I should distinguish the reasoning of Mr. Justice Pratte in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> because of the investigatory nature of the enquiry before the Review Committee, the decision of which is the only decision before me, and because, following the Review Committee's recommendation, it remained open to the Governor-in-Council to reject the Review Committee's recommendation. He referred, by analogy, to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  central to the appellant's argument, as we understand it, propositions that are related to one another. One is that the s. 40.1 process, in the case of a convention refugee, affects his or her most basic right to life, liberty and security, since it implies the potential consequence that he or she be sent to a country where he or she may well be subject to persecution. The other is that, even if we are in an immigration context, the rights affected are so basic that the standards of fundamental justice required by s. 7 of the
Charter
must be very high indeed, and close to those recognized as being applicable in the criminal context where the same basic rights are at stake.
"We dispute the validity of the first proposition. Between a determination by the designated judge that the certificate filed by the Ministers is reasonable and a possible removal of the person concerned to the country where he or she fears persecution, there must be, as required by s. 53 of the
..., a second opinion formed by the Minister of Employment and Immigration based on a determination that the person constitutes 'a danger to the public in Canada', or 'a danger to the security of Canada', a determination which will have to be made in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and which will remain subject to judicial review ..." (citations omitted)
[61]
I prefer to work by analogy to the reasoning of Mr. Justice Pratte in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , which is to say, that things should be looked at realistically. I take note of the fact, although it was only informally before me at the hearing of this matter, that by the time of the hearing, the Governor-in-Council had accepted the recommendation of the Review Committee, had directed that a certificate issue and a certificate had issued, all without the knowledge of the applicant or his counsel. The accoutrements of fundamental justice that Justice Marceau refers to as surrounding the "danger opinion" determination  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appear to have been nowhere present during the steps in this matter that followed the Review Committee recommendation.
[62]
I am satisfied that, against the guidance provided by the Supreme Court of Canada earlier reviewed, the use of the word "subversion" in paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
violates s. 7 of the
Charter
since it is, in the words of Chief Justice Lamer in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  discretion in any way."
[63]
I turn then to the question of whether the violation of s. 7 of the
Charter
that I have found to have occurred is authorized by s. 1 of the
Charter
. Once again, by analogy to the words of Mr. Justice Pratte:
"In other words, was the limitation that was imposed on the right of the appellant to [respond to the] allegations [regarding 'subversive' activity on his part, having regard to the vagueness of that term,] reasonable? Was it prescribed by law and demonstrably justified in a [free and] democratic society?"
[64]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  appropriate methodology for a s. 1 analysis set forth in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  rights and freedoms set out therein 'subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society'. It is well established that the onus of justifying the limitation of a
Charter
right rests on the party seeking to have that limitation upheld, in this case the Attorney General. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , ... this court set out two broad criteria as a framework to guide courts in determining whether a limitation is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The first is that the objective the limit is designed to achieve must be of sufficient importance to warrant overriding the constitutionally protected right or freedom. The second is that the measures chosen to achieve the objective must be proportional to the objective. The proportionality requirement has three aspects: the measures chosen must be rationally connected to the objective; they must impair the guaranteed right or freedom as little as possible; and there must be proportionality between the deleterious effects of the measures and their salutary effects." (citation omitted)
[65]
At paragraph 63 on p. 270, Mr. Justice La Forest continued:
"This court has on many occasions affirmed that the Oakes requirements must be applied flexibly, having regard to the specific factual and social context of each case. The word 'reasonable' in s. 1 necessarily imports flexibility. In a significant, but often neglected, passage from <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> itself, Dickson, C.J., warned against an overly formalistic approach to s. 1 justification, stating at p. 139 that: [a]lthough the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on the circumstances, in each case the courts will be required to balance the interest of society with those of individuals and groups."
[66]
Madame Justice McLachlin, as she then was, adopted a similar approach [see footnote 34] in her reasons  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> -MacDonald
.
[67]
On the facts of this matter, the question for determination is whether reliance on the term "subversion" in the Immigration Act in the context of the certification process, an element of which is here under review, can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, given the difficulty that reliance on that term, given its vagueness, imposes on persons such as the applicant in defending themselves against removal from Canada, to at best uncertain futures. Put another way, the question is whether the term "subversion" is unconstitutionally vague.
[68]
Against the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> test, which I do not propose to review in detail in all of its aspects against the facts of this matter, and against the cautionary guidance provided by the case law cited earlier in these reasons regarding findings of unconstitutional vagueness, I am satisfied that the use of the term "subversion" in the context in the
Immigration Act
that is here under review can be reasonably justified in the free and democratic society that is Canada.
[69]
Sections 38.1 to 40.2 of the
appear under the heading "Safety and Security of Canada". Section 38.1 recites the purpose of those provisions in the following terms which I repeat here for ease of reference:
"38.1 Recognizing that persons who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents have no right to come into or remain in Canada and that permanent residents have only a qualified right to do so, and recognizing the necessity of cooperation with foreign governments and agencies in maintaining national security, the purposes of ss. 39 to 40.2 are
(a) to enable the Government of Canada to fulfil its duty to remove persons who constitute a threat to the security or interests of Canada or whose presence endangers the lives or safety of persons in Canada;
(b) to ensure the protection of sensitive security and criminal intelligence information; and
(c) to provide a process for the expeditious removal of persons found to be members of an inadmissible class referred to in section 39 or 40.1."
It is in this context that use of the term "subversion" is here under review. The evidence before the court and the submissions before me clearly demonstrate that, while the term is vague, it has some meaning, albeit, I am satisfied, not enough to afford sufficient guidance for legal debate. Further, recommendations to clarify the term or provide alternative terminology that is less vague have not met with success. That being said, I am satisfied that the social and security objectives that the use of the term is designed to achieve are of sufficient importance to warrant overriding the constitutionally protected right of persons such as the applicant, that is infringed. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the use of the term "subversion", in the context in which it is here being considered, impairs the constitutionally protected right of the applicant as little as possible and achieves a defensible balance between the deleterious effects flowing from the use of the term and the social and security objectives to which its use is directed.
[71]
In reaching the conclusion that the use of the term "subversion" in the context in which it is before me, while it imports vagueness, does not result in
vagueness, I am guided in particular by the following words of Mr. Justice Gonthier in
Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society
[see footnote 35] where he wrote at p. 642 [S.C.R.]:
"One must be wary of using the doctrine of vagueness to prevent or impede State action in furtherance of valid social objectives, by requiring the law to achieve a degree of precision to which the subject matter does not lend itself. A delicate balance must be maintained between societal interest and individual rights."
"Subversion" - Sections 2 and 15 of the Charter
[72]
Section 2 and s. 15(1) of the
Charter
read as follows:
"2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:
(a) freedom of conscience and religion;
(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;
(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and
(d) freedom of association.
. . . . .
"15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability."
In the notice of constitutional question served on the attorneys general of the provinces and territories and of Canada in this matter, the applicant takes the position that "subversion" in paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
Immigration Act
"... lacks definitional boundaries and is overly broad, resulting in an infringement of s. 2 Freedoms and s. 15 Equality Rights under the
Charter
."
[74]
Based upon the foregoing analysis regarding the argument that "subversion" is unconstitutionally vague, the applicant has failed to satisfy me that the term, while vague, is so lacking in definitional boundaries and overly broad as to result in an infringement of s. 2 freedoms. Interpreted in a manner consistent with the terminology of paragraph (d) of the definition "threats to the security of Canada" in s. 2 of the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act
or, even more narrowly, as advocated by Professor Whitaker, it is neither without definitional boundaries nor overly broad.
[75]
I reach the same conclusion with regard to s. 15 equality rights. As to the interrelationship between the certificate process under the
Immigration Act
of which the Review Committee's investigation and recommendation that is before me forms a part, I am satisfied that the following words of Mr. Justice Pratte in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> [see footnote 36] at pp. 312 and 313  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , in respect of a different but parallel certificate process under the Immigration Act are apt to this matter:
"The appellant argued that ss. 82.1 and 83 [the basis of the certificate process there under consideration] violate s. 15 because they have the effect of depriving the appellant to whom they apply of the benefit of a hearing on the merits of their appeal on the ground that they are permanent residents. That argument has no merit. Those sections do not deprive permanent residents of a right of appeal on the ground that they are permanent residents but because they are believed to be engaged in criminal activity. This is not discrimination within the meaning of s. 15."
[76]
By analogy, the applicant here could not be said to have been deprived of a hearing in the portion of the certificate process that is here under review, that is to say, the investigation and recommendation by the Review Committee. If at a later stage there could be said to be a deprivation of a right to a hearing, it would not be on the basis that the applicant is a permanent resident but rather on the basis that, on reasonable grounds, he is believed to be engaged in subversion, or a person who might engage in subversion or might engage in activity described in paragraph 19(1)(g) of the
"Democratic Government, Institutions and Processes"
[77]
In the notice of constitutional question, the applicant urges that the expression "... democratic government, institutions and processes", as it is used in paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
where it is qualified by the words "as they are understood in Canada", "... is vague and not capable of being given a consistent and settled meaning and as such is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
. It lacks definitional boundaries, and is overly broad".
[78]
I am satisfied that the discussion of "Democracy" that was undertaken by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Reference Re Secession of Quebec
[see footnote 37] provides ample evidence that the expression "democratic government, institutions and processes", as they are understood in Canada, is not so vague as to be incapable of being given a consistent and settled meaning or to be lacking in definitional boundaries, or to be overly broad.
"Reasonable grounds to believe"
[79]
Once again in the notice of constitutional question served in this matter, the applicant takes the position that the expression "reasonable grounds to believe", as it appears in paragraphs 19(1)(e) and (g) of the
"... establishes an 'illusory' standard of defence, inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
."
[80]
"Reasonable grounds to believe" is an expression well known in Canadian law, adopted in many contexts as a standard of proof or of defence. I find no merit to the argument that it provides only an "illusory" standard of defence in the context of paragraphs 19(1)(e) and (g) of the
Immigration Act
. The applicant has failed to satisfy me that its use in those contexts is inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
.
The Review Committee's Analysis; Ignoring or Misinterpreting Evidence; Error of Law
[81]
There is no doubt that there is a great deal of conflict in the evidence that was before the Review Committee and counsel on both sides took me through the evidence in some detail. I am satisfied that the Review Committee's concerns regarding the credibility of the applicant are justified. In particular, the excerpts from the applicant's testimony that are contained in the Review Committee's report demonstrate evasiveness and a willingness to lie. The first paragraph quoted from the applicant's testimony on p. 17 of the Report is of interest. The applicant states:
"As a Palestinian who lives in Lebanon and was born in Lebanon, I am not allowed to go back to the West Bank, and I am not allowed, maybe in two years, to go back to Lebanon. I might be deported from Canada. You do not want me to lie? To survive as a human being and to survive for my children, no, I will lie and I will lie and I will lie to protect myself. And I will lie without hurting anyone because I told you, I am not that kind of person who is stupid to go and do whatever activities."
[82]
Counsel for the applicant urged that the Review Committee should have adopted a "contextual approach" as per the
decision, supra, in considering the applicant's credibility and I have a good deal of sympathy for that argument. Given the applicant's life experience, his statelessness, his commitment to re-establishment of a Palestinian homeland, his long period in Canada and his family responsibilities, it is perhaps quite unfair to demand a standard of forthrightness such as one would expect of a native-born Canadian citizen with an unqualified right to remain in Canada. Certainly the Review Committee engaged in no contextual analysis. That being said, I am not satisfied that I can extrapolate from
so as to find this lack of a contextual analysis to be a reviewable error.
[83]
Certainly there can be no doubt as to the credibility of the evidence from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ) that was before the Review Committee and this court; but the difficulty I find with respect to that evidence is whether much of it is reasonable inference or whether it is speculation and conjecture without adequate foundation. One could certainly argue that it is the latter with regard to the 1977 United Arab Emirates terrorist act. One could also argue that it is the latter with respect to the ultimate use of funds channelled back to the PFLP by the applicant, but this is not a major issue since the ultimate purpose to which those funds were put and the applicant's knowledge of that purpose were not heavily relied on by either CSIS or the Review Committee. Rather, the undisputed fact that funds were channelled through the applicant was relied on by the Review Committee simply as an indicator of the trust that was placed in him by the PFLP.
[84]
The evidence regarding the current and future capacity of the PFLP was to the effect that it is not the potent organization it once was, nor is it the radical terrorist organization that it was in the early '70s. Justice MacKay, in the first Al Yamani case [see footnote 38], described the PFLP as a "multi-faceted" organization, and I think the evidence here before the court supported that description. It continues to work within the PLO and, at least on its right wing, and that was the wing with which the applicant's father was identified, it appears committed to a peaceful solution based upon a "two-nation" model.
[85]
That being said, with great respect to my colleague Mr. Justice Cullen, and more particularly to the Review Committee, I am satisfied that, against a standard of correctness, the Review Committee erred in law in relying, without further analysis, on the definition or description of "subversion" provided in
[see footnote 39]. The Review Committee appears to have essentially ignored the compelling testimony before it of Professor Whitaker, quoted at some length earlier in these reasons, relating to the elusiveness of the concept subversion and his studied view that the concept involves two essential elements, a clandestine or deceptive element, which would appear to have been identified here, and, more importantly, an element of undermining from within. If one accepts that these elements are fundamental to any definition of subversion, then it is patently obvious that the applicant could not have been engaged in subversion against Israel, either directly or through his support of, and membership in, the PFLP.
[86]
The foregoing concerns regarding the Review Committee's analysis relate only to its conclusion that the applicant is a person described in paragraph 19(1)(e) of the
. The Review Committee's decision would nonetheless stand if I were to find that its analysis that the applicant is a person described in paragraph 19(1)(g) of the
was sufficient to support such a conclusion. I can make no such finding. Indeed, the analysis of the Review Committee in support of its finding that the applicant is a person described in paragraph 19(1)(g) of the
is even less compelling. It consists of the following three paragraphs in the reasons of the Review Committee:
"I understand Mr. Yamani's position when he highlights that Hamas, unlike the PFLP and other PLO rejectionist factions, completely boycotted the vote to amend the PLO
Charter
and the elections of representatives to the Palestinian legislature and that threats to Israel are now coming from 'organizations, like the Hamas who are not within the PLO structure'. However, I believe that the fact that Hamas effectively cut itself off from democratically influencing the vote does not mean that other rejectionist factions, such as the PFLP, who did participate actually support the amendments to the
Charter
or the terms of the peace accord.
"Terrorism has been employed as a tactic of subversive organizations, such as the PFLP. I cannot ignore this fact. There is no reason to believe that the PFLP is any less dedicated to its goals and would be any less willing to engage in terrorist actions in Canada, if that was perceived to be required to allow it to achieve its goals. I conclude, therefore, that there is still a possibility that the PFLP may commit acts of violence in Canada.
"Allowing Mr. Yamani to remain in Canada could provide logistical support for such acts of violence in Canada. I note that Mr. Yamani was assigned his tasks as a communications link and was a travel facilitator for all PFLP activities in North America by PFLP Headquarters in the Middle East because of his location in Canada."
[87]
The Review Committee makes no mention of the evidence before it that the PFLP is a "spent force". It does not reject the evidence from the applicant that the PFLP has no interest in Canada. The Review Committee cites no evidence before it that would make its conclusion that "... there is still a possibility that the PFLP may commit acts of violence in Canada" anything more than sheer speculation.
[88]
In summary, while the Review Committee's conclusion that the applicant is a person described in paragraphs 19(1)(e) and 19(1)(g) of the
might have reasonably been open to it on a more thorough and reasoned analysis of the evidence before it, against a standard of correctness, it simply cannot stand on the basis of the analysis provided.
CONCLUSION
[89]
In his supplementary Memorandum of Fact and Law, the applicant seeks the following relief:
"... that this application be allowed and [this] matter [be] remitted to a differently constituted panel of the Security Intelligence Review Committee for reconsideration in accordance with law."
[90]
Based upon the foregoing analysis, the requested relief will be granted.
[91]
I was advised by counsel during a teleconference on the 14th of March, 2000, that the requested relief, and the relief that will be granted, is not entirely moot. As noted earlier in these reasons, before the hearing of this matter in this court, the Governor-in-Council apparently accepted the recommendation of the Review Committee, directed the issuance of a certificate and a certificate issued. The applicant was summoned to an inquiry. Counsel advised that the inquiry has not been completed.
At the close of the hearing of this matter, I undertook to circulate draft reasons to counsel and to provide an opportunity for submissions on certification of a question. A version of these reasons, slightly different in form and detail, but not in substance from this version, was circulated to counsel and to counsel only. It found its way into the hands of some representatives of the media. The court convened a teleconference with counsel at which it was determined that these reasons would issue without further delay. Counsel will have until the close of business on Friday the 31st of March to provide written submissions on certification of a question or questions. If counsel so request or if the court considers it necessary, a further teleconference will be convened. On finalization of the issue of certification of a question or questions, an order will issue.
Application allowed.

38.1 Recognizing that persons who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents have no right to come into or remain in Canada and that permanent residents have only a qualified right to do so, and recognizing the necessity of cooperation with foreign governments and agencies in maintaining national security, the purposes of ss. 39 to 40.2 are
(a) to enable the Government of Canada to fulfil its duty to remove persons who constitute a threat to the security or interests of Canada or whose presence endangers the lives or safety of persons in Canada;
(b) to ensure the protection of sensitive security and criminal intelligence information; and
(c) to provide a process for the expeditious removal of persons found to be members of an inadmissible class referred to in s. 39 or 40.1.
. . . . .
39.(1) ...

. . . . .
(9) The Review Committee shall, on completion of an investigation in relation to a report made to it pursuant to subsection (2), make a report to the Governor-in-Council containing its conclusion whether or not a certificate should be issued under subsection 40(1) and the grounds on which that conclusion is based."

"I am mindful of the fact that the terms 'terrorism' and 'terrorist' are not defined in the

Canadian Security Intelligence [Service] Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-23, should apply to describe a terrorist organization in this case.

'threats to the security of Canada' means

was authorized by s. 1. Mr. Justice Pratte's colleagues did not disagree with his conclusion that s. 7 was engaged. On the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711; 135 N.R. 161, Mr. Justice Sopinka, writing for the court, expressly refrained from deciding whether deportation for serious offences amounts to a deprivation of liberty.
