Mactavish, J.
: The plaintiffs seek a stay of opposition proceedings currently pending before the Trademarks Opposition Board pertaining to the defendant's Trademark Applications Nos. 1341965 and 1341975, pending the final disposition of this action.
[2]
For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that a stay of the opposition proceedings is not warranted. Consequently, the motion will be dismissed.
Background
[3]
The plaintiffs and their predecessors have carried on business in the United States since the 1930's selling farm supplies, hardware and the like. In the 1960's, the plaintiffs expanded their business into Canada through a wholly-owned subsidiary. In 1987, the shares of the Canadian subsidiary were sold to the subsidiary's Canadian senior management.
[4]
The sale was governed by two contracts, the "Purchase Agreement" and the "Support Agreement", which purported to deal with rights to different forms of intellectual property, including various trademarks. There is a dispute between the parties with respect to the nature and extent of the rights conferred on the defendant by these agreements. The plaintiffs insist that the defendant became a licensee of the trademarks in question, whereas the defendant claims ownership of the trademarks.
[5]
On April 3, 2007, the defendant applied to register "TSC Stores" and a design version of "TSC Stores" in Canada.
[6]
By statement of claim issued on October 12, 2007, the plaintiffs commenced this action, seeking, amongst other things, a declaration that the plaintiffs are the owners of the TSC trade name, and of a number of different trademarks, including, but not limited to "TSC Stores" and the design version of the "TSC Stores" mark. The plaintiffs also seek expungement of a number of registered Canadian trademarks, damages for passing-off and an interim, interlocutory and permanent injunction restraining the defendant from using the marks in issue.
[7]
On November 30, 2007, the defendant filed a statement of defence and counterclaim, wherein the defendant seeks numerous forms of relief, including a declaration that the defendant is the owner of the "TSC Stores" trademark and the design version of the "TSC Stores" mark, damages for trademark infringement and injunctive relief.
[8]
In early 2008, the plaintiffs commenced opposition proceedings before the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in relation to the defendant's application to register the "TSC Stores" mark and the design version of the mark. The plaintiffs now seek an order staying the opposition proceedings pending the final disposition of this action.
[9]
Before turning to consider the arguments advanced by each side as to whether a stay of the opposition proceedings should be granted, a legal issue must first be decided. That is, what the appropriate test is to be applied on a motion for a stay such as this.
The Test to be Applied
[10]
The granting of a stay is a discretionary order, and I understand the parties to agree that the Court's discretionary power to stay proceedings is one that must be exercised sparingly, and only in the clearest of cases: see, for example,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 280 F.T.R. 66; 2005 FC 278, at para. 27, affd. [2005] F.C.J. No. 2118; 352 N.R. 53; 2005 FCA 434;
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 143 F.T.R. 19; 77 C.P.R.(3d) 451 (T.D.) at para. 16. and
Where the parties disagree is with respect to the test that should govern the exercise of the Court's discretion in circumstances such as this, where what is sought to be stayed is one of two proceedings which are being pursued simultaneously in different fora.
[12]
The defendant submits that it is well established in the jurisprudence that the applicable test is the tripartite test articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Q.A.C. 241.
[13]
That is, the defendant says that the plaintiffs must demonstrate:
(i) that a serious issue exists;
(ii) that they would suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted; and
(iii) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of the stay.
[14]
In support of this contention, the defendant relies on the decision of this Court in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 358 F.T.R. 292; 2010 FC 23 at para. 26, as well as the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in
In contrast, the plaintiffs argue that the proper test on a motion seeking to stay one of two parallel proceedings is the two-part test described in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 66 F.T.R. 7; 50 C.P.R.(3d) 89 (T.D.) at para. 6. There, Justice Rothstein stated that to justify the granting of a stay of proceedings, two conditions must be met, one positive and one negative. These are:
(i) The moving party must satisfy the Court that the continuation of the action will work an injustice because it would be oppressive or vexatious to him or would be an abuse of the process of the Court in some other way; and
(ii) The stay must not cause an injustice to the responding party. The onus is on the moving party to establish these conditions.
[16]
The plaintiffs point out that this was the test applied in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 84 F.T.R. 148 (T.D.), a proceeding somewhat similar to this one. The plaintiffs also rely on the decision  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Equipment Inc.
in support of their position.
[17]
Subsection 50(1) of the
Federal Courts
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, governs stays of proceedings. It provides that:
"50(1) The Court may, in its discretion, stay proceedings in any cause or matter,
(a) on the ground that the claim is being proceeded with in another court or jurisdiction; or
(b) where for any other reason it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed."
The plaintiffs rely on paragraph 50(1)(b) of the
in support of their motion, submitting that it is in the interests of justice that the opposition proceedings be stayed.
[19]
There is no question that the
RJR-MacDonald
test is often applied in stay applications. It is undoubtedly applicable where what is sought to be stayed is the enforcement of regulations, pending a judicial determination of their constitutionality. Indeed, that was the issue before the Supreme Court of Canada in the
RJR-MacDonald
The
RJR-MacDonald
test also clearly applies where what is sought to be stayed is the decision of an inferior court or tribunal, pending an appeal or application for judicial review of that decision. This was the situation facing the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the
RJR-MacDonald
test has no application. For example, a proceeding in one jurisdiction may be stayed in favour of a proceeding brought in a different jurisdiction on the basis of the principle of forum non conveniens or because the other forum is "more appropriate": see, for example, the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 304 N.R. 247; 2003 FCA 235, application for leave to appeal dismissed [2003] 2 S.C.R.p.v, and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 167 (F.C.A.).
[22]
A stay of proceedings can also be granted on the basis that the conduct of state actors is such that the proceeding in question constitutes an abuse of process: see, for example, <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , cited above,
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 361 N.R. 182; 2007 FCA 90. Once again, the
RJR-MacDonald
test has no application in such circumstances.
[23]
There is a substantial body of jurisprudence dealing with situations where a stay is being sought with respect to one of two related proceedings being pursued in different fora: see, for example,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ;  32 F.T.R. 30; 30 C.P.R.(3d) 312 (T.D.);
Association of Parents Support Groups in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 14 C.P.R.(3d) 263 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 31 C.P.R.(3d) 95 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[24]
The principles to be derived from these decisions were summarized by Justice Dubé in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>   (T.D.) at para. 5, as follows:
"1. Would the continuation of the action cause prejudice or injustice (not merely inconvenience or extra expense) to the defendant [the plaintiffs in this case] ?
2. Would the stay work an injustice to the plaintiff [the defendant in this case] ?
3. The onus is on the party which seeks a stay to establish that these two conditions are met.
4. The grant or refusal of the stay is within the discretionary power of the judge.
5. The power to grant a stay may only be exercised sparingly and in the clearest of cases.
6. Are the facts alleged, the legal issues involved and the relief sought similar in both actions?
7. What are the possibilities of inconsistent findings in both Courts?
8. Until there is a risk of imminent adjudication in the two different forums, the Court should be very reluctant to interfere with any litigant's right of access to another jurisdiction.
9. Priority ought not necessarily be given to the first proceeding over the second or, vice versa."
[25]
In considering which test should be applied in this case, I will start by considering the recent decision of this Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Equipment Inc.
, cited above, which was relied upon by both sides in support of their respective positions.
[26]
, the Court specifically considered the issue of the appropriate test to be applied on a motion for a stay of patent re-examination proceedings pending the final disposition of a patent infringement action in the Federal Court.
[27]
At paragraph 26 of the reasons, the Court identifies the
RJR-MacDonald
test as the test to be applied on such a motion. However, the decision goes on in the following paragraph to identify the factors listed in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  review of the Court's ensuing analysis discloses no explicit finding being made in relation to either the serious issue or balance of convenience components of the
RJR-MacDonald
test. Instead, the analysis seems to focus on the
is of limited assistance in this case.
[29]
There is obviously some overlap between the
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  issues of irreparable harm and balance of convenience. Given that what is really in issue in this case is whether having the two proceedings continue in tandem amounts to an abuse of process, I am of the view that considerations such as those identified in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  are the three elements of the
RJR-MacDonald
Having identified the relevant test, the next matter to decide is whether I should exercise my discretion to grant a stay in the circumstances of this case.
Should a Stay be Granted in this Case?
[31]
When this motion was originally brought, the plaintiffs were also seeking relief from any implied undertaking that may apply in relation to documents obtained by the plaintiffs from the defendant on discovery. The evidence filed by the plaintiffs in support of the motion consists of the affidavit of Alex Stanton, the Senior Vice-President of Finance and Strategy for Tractor Supply Company. Mr. Stanton's affidavit only addresses the implied undertaking issue.
[32]
Prior to the return of the stay motion, the parties settled the implied undertaking issue, which settlement is reflected in an August 18, 2010 Order of Prothonotary Aronovitch. This Order provides that "The plaintiff, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP, and the defendant are relieved from any implied undertaking". The Order grants leave to file any evidence produced in this action, including the examinations for discovery and documentary productions in the opposition proceedings.
[33]
This development distinguishes the facts of this case from the situation facing the Court in the
decision relied upon by the plaintiffs. In granting a stay of proceedings before the Registrar of Trademarks in that case pending the resolution of an action in this Court, Justice Noël was clearly influenced by the fact that the Royal Bank had obtained evidence damaging to the opposing party through the discovery process, which could not be led in the administrative proceedings before the Registrar of Trademarks.
[34]
This state of affairs satisfied Justice Noël that the continuation of the proceedings before the Registrar of Trademarks could cause serious prejudice to the Royal Bank, as the issues, including the validity of its trademarks, could not be fully debated before the Registrar of Trademarks.
[35]
Justice Noël found that the allegation made by the opposing party that the Royal Bank "did not or could not use its trademarks in relation to banking activities based on a legal prohibition should not be shielded from examination in light of the CIBC's own practice as revealed by the discovery in this action". He concluded that "[t]he continuation of the proceedings [before the Registrar of Trademarks] would be an abuse of the judicial process inasmuch as it would allow decisions to be made without the benefit of highly relevant evidence in circumstances where such evidence is known to exist and is available to both parties": all quotes at para. 16.
[36]
In light of the August 18, 2010 Order of Prothonotary Aronovitch, there is no longer any concern that the plaintiffs will be precluded from adducing relevant evidence in the opposition proceedings. In this regard, it should be noted that not only does the affidavit of Alex Stanton not identify any specific evidence that the plaintiffs will be unable to put before the Trademarks Opposition Board, it also fails to identify any other prejudice that will be suffered by the plaintiffs if the opposition proceedings are not stayed.
[37]
A review of the pleadings in this action together with the statements of opposition in the opposition proceedings discloses that there is some commonality of parties between the two matters, although is appears that the Tractor Supply Company is not a party to the opposition proceedings. There is also some overlap between the issues raised in the two proceedings as relates to nature and extent of the defendant's rights with respect to the "TSC Stores" trademark and the design version of the "TSC Stores" mark. However, the relief sought in the two proceedings is different.
[38]
In the opposition proceedings, the plaintiffs seek the dismissal of the defendant's applications for registration of the two marks in question. In contrast, in this Court, the plaintiffs are seeking a declaration that they are the owners of the TSC trade name, and of a number of different trademarks, including, but not limited to the two in issue in the opposition proceedings. The plaintiffs are also seeking expungement of various registered Canadian trademarks (not including the two in issue in the opposition proceedings which have yet to be registered), damages and injunctive relief.
[39]
While there is always some risk of inconsistent findings whenever two matters proceed in different fora, the plaintiffs have not persuaded me that there is a significant risk of inconsistent findings in this case. This is not a situation such as that facing the Court in the
case discussed earlier, where the substantial differences in the evidentiary record in the two proceedings gave rise to a real risk of inconsistent results.
[40]
Furthermore, unlike the situation that faced the Court  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Equipment Inc.
, there is no suggestion that allowing the opposition proceedings to continue could render this action nugatory: see
In this regard, it should be observed that in the event that the plaintiffs lose before the Trademarks Opposition Board, it is always open to them to amend their statement of claim in this action to seek expungement of the registration of the two disputed marks on the ground of lack of entitlement.
[42]
The plaintiffs also argued at the hearing of this motion that the Trademarks Opposition Board is not well-positioned to decide the complex issues of credibility that surround the question of ownership to the trademarks in question. Not only was this argument not even mentioned in the plaintiffs' memorandum of fact and law, the plaintiffs have also failed to identify what these credibility issues are with any degree of particularity.
[43]
Consequently, while I accept that the continuation of the opposition proceedings may cause inconvenience and expense to the plaintiffs, they have not persuaded me that it would be oppressive or vexatious or an abuse of process in some other way.
[44]
I am also satisfied that the delay in the proceedings before the Trademarks Opposition Board denying the defendant access to the trademark registration process and the potential statutory advantages of having registered trademarks would cause prejudice to the defendant: see
Finally, I note that the opposition proceedings have been ongoing since February of 2008. Evidence has been filed by both sides, and cross-examinations have taken place on that evidence. Additional evidence obtained from the discoveries in this action is now being put before the Trademarks Opposition Board as a result of Prothonotary Aronovitch's August 18 Order. One would have thought that if the plaintiffs were really concerned about prejudice or injustice arising from the Trademarks Opposition Board proceedings, the motion for a stay would have been brought long before this.
[46]
The plaintiffs have thus failed to persuade me that this is one of "the clearest of cases" where it is in the interests of justice that a stay of the proceedings before the Trademarks Opposition Board should be granted. Consequently, the plaintiffs' motion is dismissed.
Would the Result have been Different had I Applied the RJR-MacDonald Test?
[47]
Before concluding, and in the event that a reviewing Court were to take a different view as to the legal test applicable on a motion such as this, I would simply note that my conclusion that the motion should be dismissed would not have changed, had I applied the
RJR-MacDonald
To be entitled to a stay using the
RJR-MacDonald
test, the party seeking the stay must adduce clear and non-speculative evidence that irreparable harm will follow if their motion is denied: see, for example,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 2005 FC 815, at para. 59, aff'd. [2005] N.R. Uned. 155; 44 C.P.R.(4th) 326; 2005 FCA 390.
[49]
As was noted earlier, the affidavit of Alex Stanton addresses the prejudice that the plaintiffs say they would have faced before the Trademarks Opposition Board, had they not been relieved from their implied undertaking. That is no longer in issue, in light of Prothonotary Aronovitch's August 18 Order. There is no clear and non-speculative evidence before the Court of any other form of irreparable harm that will be suffered by the plaintiffs if the Trademarks Opposition Board proceedings are not stayed.
Costs
[50]
I am of the view that the defendant should have its costs of the motion, which are fixed at $1,500.
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES
that
the motion for a stay is dismissed, with costs to the defendant fixed in the amount of $1,500.
Motion dismissed.
