: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the "Commission"), dated May 28, 1990, made pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the
CHRA
), dismissing the applicant's complaints of discrimination and harassment against her employer, the Department of National Health and Welfare. For the reasons contained herein I have dismissed this application.
Background
[2]
The applicant commenced employment with the Department of National Health and Welfare in 1982, where she occupied a social science support research assistant position. In her opinion, she was forced to leave on December 4, 1986, and has been on long-term disability since March 5, 1987.
[3]
The applicant alleges discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex and disability as follows: (a) because she is a woman she was hired only in a support position, thereby limiting her career opportunities; (b) she was disadvantaged in terms of training opportunities and assignments; (c) she was discriminated against on the basis of her disability (Lupus) which she argues was not tolerated or accommodated; (d) she was sexually harassed by her superior, who, she contends, gave her inappropriate gifts; sabotaged her work; failed to communicate required information; and harassed her due to her disability.
[4]
The applicant first contacted the Canadian Human Rights Commission, National Capital Regional Office ("NCRO"), on September 15, 1987. In October and November 1987, she provided detailed information regarding her complaint. In addition, the applicant identified eighteen (18) witnesses who could provide information.
[5]
The applicant was advised by letter dated December 4, 1987, that none of the alleged discriminatory acts, which could be considered in time, i.e., from September 15, 1986, to September 15, 1987, appeared to "be based on any of the ten grounds of discrimination under the
Canadian Human Rights Act
(
CHRA
)".
[6]
Nevertheless, the applicant filed a complaint with the Commission, on February 9, 1988, alleging discrimination on the grounds of disability and sex, contrary to ss. 7, 10 and 13.1 of the
CHRA
. The Commission did investigate the complaint.
[7]
The applicant received a number of documents pertaining to her complaint by way of access to information requests. One such document, a preliminary summary report, revealed that initially, due to the date of the alleged acts, only certain of the applicant's allegations would be examined. However, this was reconsidered and all acts and grounds of discrimination were investigated commencing in the summer of 1988, when Ms. Wendy Wood was appointed as investigator, pursuant to s. 43(1).
[8]
In the same period, the applicant wrote the Commission to express her dissatisfaction with the Commission's complaint procedure and what she perceived to be undue delay. The applicant was afforded an interview with an NCRO official, on August 12, 1988. The Commission acknowledged that the process also was taking too long. However, Ms. Wood's preliminary investigation was completed in early 1989. On February 28, 1989, prior to any interviews, the applicant contacted Ms. Wood alerting her to the possibility that a certain witness's testimony was going to be biased. The applicant contended that a proposed witness had been shown the complaint and, due to friendship, would support the alleged harasser.
[9]
Meanwhile, Ms. Wood commenced interviews in March 1989 and the applicant met with the investigator for a lengthy interview on June 9, 1989. The applicant was dissatisfied with her interview which she described as highly structured and foreclosed opportunity to advance further evidence. Moreover, the applicant alleges a violation of the Commission's policy manual, as the investigator allegedly did not advise the applicant of the respondent's rebuttal to her complaint. The applicant also declined to sign the investigator's notes of the meeting, which she considered to be inaccurate. All of this was reflected in a letter to the Commission, dated June 14, 1989.
[10]
The applicant was also troubled by a memo, which she perceived as demonstrating investigative bias, from the Director of Complaints Procedures Branch, to the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Yalden, which stated:
"As you will see from Ms. Jennings' letter, she is an articulate and well-prepared complainant. She has obtained a copy of our Compliance Manual under the Freedom of Information regulations, and brings it to her meetings with Wendy Wood, the NCRO investigator designated to handle her case.
"Ms. Jennings is in frequent contact with Bonnie Robichaud and other members of her network, and is absolutely determined to control the manner in which our investigation is conducted. For this reason, my draft reply is worded rather more strongly that would normally be the case. While we might not wish to express our confidence in every investigator and/or Regional Director in an inequivocal [sic] manner, I believe that such a statement is fully justified in this case. Given the complainant's determination to assume complete control of the investigation, it seems to be an advisable position."
In response to the applicant's June 14, 1989, letter, the Deputy Chief Commissioner, Ms. Michelle Falardeau-Ramsay, advised the applicant that she denied any allegation of bias and supported the integrity of the Commission's investigative staff.
[11]
On November 21, 1989, Ms. Wood submitted her investigator's report, pursuant to s. 44(1) of the
CHRA
. That report was forwarded to the Director of Complaints Procedures Branch with the following covering memo:
"The attached report is seventeen (17) pages long. I know it is longer than usual. However, considering the following:
- the nature of the complaint,
- the length of the complaint,
- the number of allegations,
- the continuous monitoring of the investigation by the complainant,
I consider that the report should be presented as such to the Members of the Commission. Senior Management and the Members of the Commission should be alerted to the fact that every single little item should be included to ensure that the complainant does not submit that we did not look at a given point that she brought up."
The applicant received the report on January 22, 1990, and was advised that the investigator's recommendation to the Commission would be that the complaint be dismissed. The letter also indicated that the Commission was free to accept or reject the recommendation as contained in the report.
[12]
The applicant then filed a 90 page rebuttal report alleging, inter alia, that the investigator: misrepresented facts; misinterpreted policies and definitions; omitted to interview or interviewed witnesses selectively; omitted to include certain testimony in her report; and recommended dismissal of the complaint without a reasonable basis for making such a recommendation.
[13]
At a meeting of the Commission, held on May 24, 1990, the applicant's complaint was reviewed. In addition to the original complaint, the Commission considered the investigator's report, the applicant's rebuttal submissions, as well as the respondent's submissions regarding the report.
[14]
The applicant's complaint was dismissed, as being unfounded, pursuant to s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
CHRA
, which provides:
"44(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission
(b) shall dismiss the complaint to which the report relates if it is satisfied
(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted,"
The Commission's decision was conveyed to the applicant by letter dated May 28, 1990. In this regard, one member dissented.
While the applicant raised several other issues in her Originating Notice of Motion, the following were argued at the hearing:
1. Did the Commission err in dismissing the applicant's complaint without having regard to "all the circumstances of the complaint"?
2. Did the Commission err in adopting the investigator's report?
3. Was the investigation of the applicant's complaint biased?
Applicant's Position
[16]
Given the nature of the complaint, I find it necessary to outline the applicant's arguments in some detail. The applicant attacks the adequacy of the investigation and investigator's report in terms of both neutrality and thoroughness. According to the applicant, by relying on a flawed report, the Commission cannot have had regard to "all the circumstances of the complaint". The applicant relies on the decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D).
[17]
In terms of the thoroughness of the investigation, the applicant alleges the following: (1) the investigator failed to interview all relevant witnesses in the complaint; (2) the investigator failed to question co-workers on matters, other than harassment, such as management's knowledge of her disability and on her work assignments; (3) the investigator's report contained omissions, including a letter from the applicant's union representative, supporting the applicant's complaint; and (4) the report contained misrepresentations of fact, as well as misinterpretations of Commission policies on what constitutes harassment and disability. For example, the applicant argues that the investigator erred in concluding that there were no adverse effects from the exchange of gifts.
[18]
In terms of the neutrality of the investigation, the applicant argues that the Director of Complaint Procedures Branch was biased in her reaction to the applicant's extensive involvement in pressing her complaint to the Commission, as well as in her apparent support of the objectivity of the investigation, in face of the applicant's tenacity. It is argued that since the Director presents a complaint to the Commission, she has a role in the decision-making process which, in this instance, lacks neutrality and objectivity. Moreover, the applicant argues that when the Deputy Chief Commissioner supported the objectivity of the Commission's investigator, by letter, this was also improper given her role in the decision-making process, as a voting member of the Commission.
[19]
The applicant also argues that the practice of having the investigator make a recommendation in a report raises a reasonable apprehension of bias by fettering the Commission's discretion if it agrees with the recommendation. In other words, the Commission's decision is virtually predetermined. In this regard, the applicant argues that the investigator, in this instance, reached a conclusion and wrote a report keeping that end in mind.
In the respondent's submission, in this instance, the Commission had before it all relevant circumstances to the complaint. If there were any shortcomings, which is denied, they were "cleansed" by the applicant's rebuttal report. With respect to what constitutes harassment, the respondent argues that on judicial review it is not the court's role to question the wisdom of the decision or to weigh the evidence and substitute its view for that of the Commission. In particular, the respondent directs the court to Mr. Justice La Forest's comments in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 584 and 585 S.C.R., where he states as follows:
"The courts have also been willing to show deference to administrative tribunals for reasons of relative expertise. This is in addition to the normal deference of reviewing courts in respect of questions of fact ..."
[21]
The respondent submits that there is no evidence to support the applicant's allegations of bias. The respondent argues that even if the Director of Complaints Procedures presented the applicant's file to the Commission, this does not, in and of itself, fetter the Commission's discretion or its "open-mindedness" which, in the respondent's submission, is the appropriate test regarding bias:
, supra, at p. 18. Moreover, the respondent argues that no actions on the part of the Commission, with respect to a letter sent by Ms. Falardeau-Ramsay, the Deputy Chief Commissioner, in support of the staff of the Commission, were improper.
[22]
The respondent also contends that the Commission is by statute mandated to function both administratively, i.e., in an investigatory manner, and as a decision-maker. Accordingly, the respondent argues that, in light of the decision in
Barry and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 241, the
administrative law principle, "nemo judex", has no application in this case. The respondent also asserts that not only is it appropriate for a recommendation to be included in the report, it is also beneficial. The Commission is free to disagree and to not do so does not fetter discretion. Indeed, one member dissented.
The
Canadian Human Rights Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, confers a broad discretion on the Canadian Human Rights Commission regarding complaint investigation. Where the Commission proceeds by way of investigation, as in this case, the Commission may decide to request the appointment of a Human Rights Tribunal to inquire into the complaint. Alternatively, inter alia, the Commission can dismiss the complaint. In either case, these types of investigations are obviously lengthy, labour-intensive, and invariably emotionally charged.
[24]
Mr. Justice Sopinka in
), at p. 897  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , described the Commission's decision, at this stage, to be administrative, subject to review on procedural fairness grounds and not on the "full panoply of the rules of natural justice". The content of the duty of fairness must be determined with respect to the particular circumstances of the case. At this stage, in order to satisfy the duty of fairness, the Commission had to provide the applicant with the substance of the evidence obtained by the investigator and provide the applicant an opportunity to respond to such evidence and make representations:
The Commission is entitled, by virtue of s. 43(1), to appoint an investigator. As Mr. Justice Sopinka noted in
, supra, at p. 898  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , investigation is essential for the Commission to carry out its role under s. 39 (now s. 44). In fact, it is the intent of s. 44 that the Commission rely on the investigator's report.
[26]
The Commission provided the applicant with a copy of the investigator's report and allowed her the opportunity to respond. However, as recognized by Mr. Justice Nadon, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 598 F.C.:
"... underlying these requirements is the assumption that another aspect of procedural fairness - that the
CHRA
had an adequate and fair basis on which to evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant appointment of a tribunal - existed."
"In order for a fair basis to exist for the CHRC to evaluate whether a tribunal should be appointed pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the
, I believe that the investigation conducted prior to this decision must satisfy at least two conditions: neutrality and thoroughness."
Mr. Justice Nadon in
, supra., at pp. 600 and 601 F.C. further stated:
"In determining the degree of thoroughness of investigation required ... one must be mindful of the interests that are being balanced: the complainant's and the respondent's interests in procedural fairness and the CHRC's interests in maintaining a workable and administratively effective system. ...
"Deference must be given to administrative decision-makers to assess the probative value of evidence and to decide to further investigate or not to further investigate accordingly. It should not only be where unreasonable omissions are made, for example where an investigator failed to investigate obviously crucial evidence, that judicial review is warranted. Such an approach is consistent with the deference allotted to fact-finding activities of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal by the Supreme Court in the case of
"In contexts where parties have the legal right to make submissions in response to an investigator's report, such as in the case at bar, parties may be able to compensate for more minor omissions by bringing such omissions to the attention of the decision- maker. Therefore, it should be only where complainants are unable to rectify such omissions that judicial review would be warranted. Although this is by no means an exhaustive list, it would seem to me that circumstances where further submissions cannot compensate for an investigator's omissions would include: (1) where the omission is of such fundamental nature that merely drawing the decision-maker's attention to the omission cannot compensate for it or (2) where fundamental evidence is inaccessible to the decision-maker by virtue of the protected nature of the information or where the decision-maker explicitly disregards it."
[27]
With regards to the applicant's contention that the investigator failed to interview all relevant witnesses or failed to question certain witness on all relevant issues, Mr. Justice Nadon's comments, in
"The fact that the investigator did not interview each and every witness that the Applicant would have liked her to and the fact that the conclusion reached by the investigator did not address each and every alleged incident of discrimination are not in and of themselves fatal as well. This is particularly the case where the Applicant has the opportunity to fill in gaps left by the investigator in subsequent submissions of her own. In the absence of guiding regulations, the investigators, much like the CHRC, must be master of its own procedure, and judicial review of an allegedly deficient investigation should only be warranted where the investigation is clearly deficient."
It is my opinion that this reasoning is also applicable to the allegation that the investigator misrepresented facts or misinterpreted Commission policy. Moreover, Mr. Justice Nadon's comments, in
"In the spirit of the Supreme Court of Canada in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , deference must prevail over interventionism insofar as the CHRC deals with matters of fact-finding and adjudication, particularly with respect to matters over which the CHRC has been vested with such wide discretion, as in the case of the decision whether or not to dismiss a complaint pursuant to subsection 44(3)."
[28]
It is well-established that on judicial review of a discretionary decision, the court should not intervene unless the discretion has been exercised on some wrong principle, without regard to relevant factors or on the basis of irrelevant facts, or without regard to procedural fairness:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 7 S.C.R. Moreover, as Mr. Justice Teitelbaum notes in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), at p. 122, the court "may review the exercise of discretionary power where such power has been exercised in a discriminatory, unfair, capricious or unreasonable manner".
[29]
I am not persuaded that the alleged omissions, misrepresentations or misinterpretations, in the investigator's report, are of such a fundamental nature that they deprived the Commission of the opportunity to base its decision on "all the circumstances of the complaint". In this case, the applicant was given an opportunity to rebut the investigator's report and bring to the Commission's attention the deficiencies she felt were in the report, including allegations of bias and various omissions. Her submissions were extensive. On balance, I am of the opinion that the alleged deficiencies in the investigator's report cannot be said to have resulted in the applicant being denied procedural fairness in this case.
[30]
With regards to the applicant's challenge to the objectivity or neutrality of the investigation and the investigator's report, the
decision, supra, is instructive. Where the Commission renders its decision without reasons, which, by virtue of
, supra, it is entitled to do, the report can be considered as underpinning the reasons for the decision. Therefore, it follows, that the investigator's report must be fair and without bias. The standard under which this is to be examined is whether, as a matter of fact, the open-mindedness of the Commission has been lost to the point where it can be said that the decision has been predetermined:
The applicant was not satisfied with the manner in which the investigation was conducted. This fact is reflected in the memo, dated June 26, 1989, from the Director of Complaints Procedure, to the Commission. However, the fact that the memo was sent to the Commission, does not establish bias or a lack of open-mindedness. The investigation was not considered by the Director. While she may have presented the report to the Commission for a decision, this does not in any way signify that the decision of the Commission was predetermined or that its discretion was fettered. There was no error in principle or in procedural fairness. Further, with respect to the allegation that Ms. Falardeau-Ramsay's response to the applicant's letter dated June 14, 1989, concerning her dissatisfaction with the investigator, was improper, I am of the opinion that the legislative scheme contemplates administrative, investigatory as well as adjudicative functions. As the Supreme Court noted in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , supra, at pp. 309 and 310, a reasonable apprehension of bias cannot be said to exist if the official did not act outside his or her statutory authority and if there is no evidence to show involvement beyond fulfilling statutory duties, which, in my opinion, is the situation in this case. Accordingly, the applicant's allegation of bias is not well-founded.
[32]
I do not agree with the argument that an investigator cannot make a recommendation to the Commission. The Commission is free to accept or disregard a particular recommendation. A recommendation by the investigator to the Commission, in and of itself, does not violate the principle that a discretionary power should be exercised only by those to whom it is given. Nor does the power become hampered by an improper constraint or restriction: H.W.R. Wade et al.,
Administrative Law
(7th Ed. 1994) (Oxford: Clarendon Press), at p. 347. Indeed, there are cases where the Commission has disagreed with an investigator's report recommendation: see for instance,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). There is no evidence upon which I can conclude that the recommendation procedure gives rise to bias, forecloses open-mindedness or predetermines the Commission's decision as to whether a particular complaint warrants the recommendation that a Human Rights Tribunal be appointed.
[33]
Accordingly, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
