Jerome, A.C.J.
: The respondents' applications by way of originating notice of motion for a review, pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the
Income Tax Act
, of my order dated July 18, 1989 were held together at Toronto, Ontario on January 15, 1990, January 19, 1990 and on April 2, 1990. The order, commonly referred to as a "jeopardy collection order", was granted on an ex parte application pursuant to s. 225.2(2) and authorized the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") to forthwith take any of the collection actions described in ss. 225.1(1)(a) to (g) of the
Income Tax Act
with respect to the respondents' tax debt. On August 21, 1990 at Toronto, Ontario, I dismissed the respondents' applications for reasons given orally from the Bench and indicated that these written reasons would follow.
Background:
[2]
By notices of assessment and reassessments dated June 15, 1989 the respondent Duncan was assessed and reassessed with respect to his 1985, 1986 and 1987 taxation years and the respondent Petroff was reassessed with respect to his 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 taxation years. This resulted in an unpaid income tax liability of $511,621.41 for the respondent Duncan and an unpaid income tax liability of $583,512.27 for the respondent Petroff.
[3]
On February 11, 1988 the respondents were apprehended in the United States of America and charged with drug trafficking offenses. The respondents were subsequently released on bail upon each posting a cash bond with the United States court in the amount of $750,000 U.S. On October 3, 1989 the respondents pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute a narcotic substance and agreements were reached between the Assistant United States Attorney and the respondents, subject to judicial approval, that the sentence to be imposed would be 121 months in jail. The respondents signed consent judgments directing payment to the United States government of money in the amount of $1,021,010 which was in their possession and seized by the United States authorities at the time of their arrest.
[4]
By originating notice of motion dated July 17, 1989 the applicant made an ex parte motion pursuant to s. 225.2(2) of the
Income Tax Act
on July 1989 for an order authorizing the Minister to proceed without delay on collection proceedings with respect to the respondents' tax debt. Upon hearing counsel for the applicant and upon reading the affidavits of Terry Hale, Chief of Collections, Mississauga District Office of Revenue Canada, sworn July 14 and July 18, 1989, by order dated July 18, 1989 I authorized the Minister to take forthwith any of the actions described in ss. 225.1(a) to (g) of the
Income Tax Act
. I also directed that service of the order be effected by sending a photostatic copy to the respondents by registered mail on or before July 21, 1989.
[5]
On July 18, 1989, certificates were registered in the Federal Court of Canada pursuant to s. 223 of the
Income Tax Act
certifying that the respondents were in arrears with respect to taxes. As a result of the order, the Minister caused registrations to be made on the title of certain properties of the respondents. By notice of motion dated July 26, 1989 the applicant sought an order that, unless sufficient cause to the contrary be shown, the respondent Duncan's lands described in Instrument No. CT847090 registered in the Land Registry Office in Toronto be charged with the judgment in favour of the applicant in the amount of $517,456.47, together with interest as specified in the certificate dated July 18, 1989. A "Charging Order to Show Cause" was issued on July 27, 1989.
[6]
By notice of motion dated August 18, 1989, the respondents apply pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the
for a review of the order of July 18, 1989 and, by supplementary notice of motion dated August 24, 1989, the respondent Duncan seeks inter alia to set aside the Charging Order to Show Cause dated July 27, 1989, on the basis that proper disclosure had not been made. They also allege that both s. 225.2 of the
and the order and directions thereto are an unreasonable seizure contrary to s. 8 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Constitution Act, 1982
(the "
Charter
"), that they deny the respondents' right to life, liberty and security of the person contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
, and that they constitute cruel and unusual treatment or punishment contrary to s. 12 of the
Charter
.
Relevant Statutory Provisions:
[7]
The relevant statutory provisions are ss. 225.1 and 225.1 [see footnote 1] of the
Income Tax Act
as amended by S.C. 1988, c. 55, ss. 169 and 170:
"225.1(1) Where a taxpayer is liable for the payment of an amount assessed under this Act, the Minister shall not, for the purpose of collecting the amount,
(a) commence legal proceedings in a court,
(b) certify the amount under s. 223,
(c) require a person to make a payment under subsection 224(1),
(d) require an institution or a person to make a payment under subsection 224(1.1),
(e) require the retention of the amount by way of deduction or set-off under s. 224.1,
(f) require a person to turn over moneys under subsection 224.3(1), or
(g) give a notice, issue a certificate or make a direction under subsection 225(1)
before the day that is 90 days after the day of mailing of the notice of assessment.
"225.2(1) In this section, 'judge' means a judge or a local judge of a superior court of a province or a judge of the Federal Court of Canada.
"(2) Notwithstanding s. 225.1, where, on an ex parte application by the Minister, a judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or any part of an amount assessed in respect of a taxpayer would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof, he shall, on such terms as he considers reasonable in the circumstances, authorize the Minister to take forthwith any of the actions described in paragraphs 225.1(1)(a) to (g) with respect to the amount.
. . . . .
"(4) Statements contained in an affidavit filed in the context of an application under this section may be based on belief with the grounds therefor.
"(5) An authorization granted under this section in respect of a taxpayer shall be served by the Minister on the taxpayer within 72 hours after it is granted, except where the judge orders the authorization to be served at some other time specified in the authorization, and, where a notice of assessment has not been sent to the taxpayer at or before the time of the application, the notice of assessment shall be served together with the authorization.
"(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), service on a taxpayer shall be effected by
(a) personal service on the taxpayer; or
(b) service in accordance with directions, if any, of a judge.
. . . . .
"(8) Where a judge of a court has granted an authorization under this section in respect of a taxpayer, the taxpayer may, upon six clear days notice to the Deputy Attorney General of Canada, apply to a judge of the court to review the authorization.
"(9) An application under subsection (8) shall be made
(a) within 30 days from the day on which the authorization was served on the taxpayer in accordance with this section; or
(b) within such further time as a judge may allow, upon being satisfied that the application was made as soon as practicable.
. . . . .
"(11) On an application under subsection (8), the judge shall determine the question summarily and may confirm, set aside or vary the authorization and may make such other order as he considers appropriate.
. . . . .
"(13) No appeal lies from an order of a judge made pursuant to subsection (11)."
The issues may be summarized as follows:
1. The application and effect of the
Charter
with respect to the order dated July 18, 1989; and
2. Has the test required by s. 225.2 of the
Income Tax Act
been met. Were there reasonable grounds to consider that the collection of the amounts assessed in respect of the respondents would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof and was there was full and frank disclosure on the ex parte application.
The
Charter
The respondents submit that the ex parte order dated July 18, 1989 pursuant to s. 225.2(2) of the
Income Tax Act
is contrary to ss. 7 and 8 of the
Charter
although they concede that the statutory provision itself is not under attack in this proceeding. They suggest, however, that the deficiencies contained in s. 225.2 can be "read down" for our present purposes and that the order should be measured against the statutory provisions as properly interpreted in accordance with the
Charter
. In the alternative, the respondents submit that the order constitutes an unreasonable seizure in that it does not comply with the stringent requirements for a reasonable search and seizure enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 291; 9 C.R.R. 355; 14 C.C.C.(3d) 97; 41 C.R.(3d) 97; [1984] 6 W.W.R. 577; 33 Alta. L.R.(2d) 193; 27 B.L.R. 297; 84 D.T.C. 6467; 2 C.P.R.(3d) 1; 11 D.L.R.(4th) 641. The order authorizing immediate collection action is an unreasonable seizure because it was made upon virtually no evidence or credibly-based probability that such actions were required to prevent evasion of the payment of the assessed taxes such as to prevail over the respondents' rights to be "left alone".
[10]
The respondents further submit that in this instance, the deprivation of their property by the Minister affects the respondents' right to life, liberty and security of the person contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
. The "freezing" or "seizure" of their assets while facing serious criminal charges and other legal proceedings that may result in incarceration if unsuccessfully or inadequately defended, is an infringement of their s. 7
Charter
rights. In addition, the interference, authorized on an ex parte application, is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
[11]
The applicant submits, however, that an enactment that provides for a judicial prior authorization of a search does not necessarily offend s. 8 of the
Charter
. Furthermore, the applicant suggests that the only appropriate forum for constitutional challenges or declaratory judgments is that involving a trial and not a motion or summary proceeding. In any event, the applicant suggests that the respondents' arguments are misdirected in view of the fact that an order under s. 225.2 and the directions thereto do no constitute a "seizure" for the purposes of s. 8 of the
Charter
. Furthermore, s. 8 does not relate to real property rights and s. 7 does not extend to protect property and pure economic rights. Finally, the effect of s. 225.2 is not a punishment as that term is used in s. 12 of the
Charter
.
Has The Test Required By S. 225.2
Of The
Income Tax Act
The essential elements of the respondents' arguments are summarized as follows. The respondents state that mortgages were placed or renewed on their real property in Canada and that assets were encumbered or sold only in an effort to raise funds to cover bail-related and living expenses and for no improper purpose. The respondents explained that in California they were required to satisfy the court that no drug-related funds were used as bail, so mortgage funds were obtained.
[13]
The respondents state that although the notices or reassessment were dated June 15, 1989, they were not mailed until July 17, 1989 and they suggest that at least a genuine attempt to give notice of the reassessments was a condition precedent to the relief granted in the order. Furthermore, they suggest that material facts were not disclosed and that misleading evidence was presented at the ex parte hearing. They suggest that Mr. Hale's affidavits intimate that they were selling or encumbering their assets in breach of the conditions of bail. They state that there was no evidence that they had disposed of or attempted to dispose of assets subsequent to the dates of the notices and that there is no evidence that they were attempting to avoid their tax obligations. Rather, the respondents state that assets were dealt with in the ordinary course of utilization and they submit that the applicant has failed to show that the collection of moneys owing for taxes would be "jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof".
[14]
The applicant submits that if the evidence on the balance of probabilities leads to a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the collection would be jeopardized by a delay then the order should be allowed to stand. Relying on the decision of Joyal, J., in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 5 F.T.R. 161 (F.C.T.D.), the applicant submits that the nature of the assessment itself raises reasonable apprehension that the order is justified.
The
Charter
After carefully considering the extensive argument put forth by the parties I find that the
Charter
should not form a part of the judgment in this matter for the following reasons. First, the parties acknowledge that the relevant sections of the
Income Tax Act
are not under attack in this application and they cannot be attacked in a proceeding of this nature. In
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (C.A.), at p. 515, Le Dain, J.A. (as he then was), on behalf of the court, held that "under the
declaratory relief cannot be sought by originating motion but only by an action". More recently, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Dubé, J., explained this requirement (at p. 11):
"I appreciate that time was and still is of the essence ... but constitutional matters cannot be solved on such a summary proceeding. The solution is for the application to proceed by way of a declaratory action that would allow for pleadings and discovery. The court, apprised of all the relevant facts and with the benefit of legal arguments, would then be in a position to adjudge whether or not the equitable basis principle as interpreted by the court is now in violation of s. 15 of the
Charter
."
[16]
Also, I note that in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  concerns:
"The notice of motion attacks s. 225.2 of the
Income Tax Act
. I believe that it is misdirected. That section does not provide for anything even resembling a seizure of the money, nor even for the institution of collection procedures. It provides only for a decision of the Minister to override the 90 day delay of collection procedures imposed by s. 225.1. As a result of the decision taken under s. 225.2, it only becomes open to the Minister to take immediate collection actions as authorized elsewhere in the
, if he so desires.
"Thus, [the] attack on s. 225.2 is in my view quite misdirected and fails because of its misconception of what that section does. In spite of that conclusion, it is evident that the applicant really seeks to attack the collection powers statutorily given to the Minister by ss. 222, 223 and 224 of the
The constitutional validity of other sections of the
Income Tax Act
related to administrative enforcement mechanisms has also been considered by this court.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), Dubé, J., determined that ss. 222, 223(2) and 158(1) of the
Income Tax Act
, 1970-71-72, c. 63 [see footnote 2], were not contrary to s. 8 of the
Charter
. In that case there was no allegation that the collection proceedings were not carried out according to the provisions set out in the
. However, the applicant in effect sought a declaration that these provisions were contrary to s. 8 of the
Charter
. Dubé, J., commented (at p. 564):
"The applicant offers no jurisprudence to support such a sweeping demand. The crux of his argument, as I understand it, is that the common shares in his company ought not to be seized pending his appeal as 'at the present time I am not in a position to provide payment of the assessed amounts'. This is surely not evidence of a breach of the applicant's rights to be secure against seizure.
"As I pointed out at the hearing, the
Income Tax Act
is a rigorous document. Parliament has ruled that taxes be paid within 30 days from assessment, whether the taxpayer files an appeal or not. The obvious purpose of such an imposition is to prevent a massive wave of taxpayers' appeals launched for the sole purpose of delaying the payment of taxes."
[18]
Finally, as acknowledged by counsel for the respondents, the
Charter
does not in specific terms directly affect property rights and I have grave doubts that what took place here constitutes a "seizure". The result of the application was not a seizure in the true sense of the word. Indeed, the taxpayers' assets were not altered in any way and there was no transfer of title. While the filing of a caution on title may prevent or otherwise restrict the disposition of the property, it is far from certain that it constitutes a seizure. I do not believe that activities pursued by the Minister in accordance with the administrative enforcement mechanisms of a regulatory statute that effectively "freeze" a taxpayer's assets constitute a "seizure" in the sense required to bring these activities within the scrutiny of the standards set by the Supreme Court in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  the
Income Tax Act
and the respondents'
Charter
arguments cannot succeed.
Has The Test Required By S. 225.2
Of The
Income Tax Act
In reviewing the authorization granted under s. 225.2(2), it is necessary to consider whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or any part of an amount assessed in respect of a taxpayer would be jeopardized by the delay in the collection thereof. McNair, J., in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at p. 6519; 7 F.T.R. 42; 2 C.T.C. 380 at p. 381 (F.C.T.D.), enunciated the test to be met with respect to the previous s. 225.2(1):
"... the issue is not whether the collection per se is in jeopardy but rather whether the actual jeopardy arises from the likely delay in the collection thereof."
[21]
This test continues to be appropriate despite the 1985 amendments:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 30 F.T.R. 94 (F.C.T.D.). In
Satellite Earth
, MacKay, J., reviewed the factors to be considered by a court on a s. 225.2(8) review of a jeopardy collection order. After considering the case law dealing with the former version of s. 225.2 he concluded (at D.T.C. 5510) that in a s. 225.2(8) application the Minister has the ultimate burden of justifying the decision despite the fact that s. 225.2 as amended no longer includes the former paragraph (5) that specifically stated that "on the hearing of an application under paragraph 2(c), the burden of justifying the decision is on the Minister". However, the initial burden is on the taxpayer to show that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test has been met.
"In an application to review a 'jeopardy order' originally granted under paragraph 225.2(2) the issue will be whether that Order will now be set aside or varied. In this, an applicant under paragraph 225.2(8) has the initial burden to muster evidence, whether by affidavits, by cross-examination of affiants on behalf of the Crown, or both, that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test required by paragraph 225.2(2) has been met. Thus the ultimate burden on the Crown established by paragraph 225.2(2) continues when an order granted by the court is reviewed under paragraph 225.2(8).
"Occasionally there may be concern about whether the Order should have been made initially, but I expect that this will not often be the principal focus, unless there appears to have been a serious procedural flaw in the original application.
"... The evidence must be considered in relation to the test established by paragraph 225.2(2) itself and by relevant cases, that is, whether on a balance of probability the evidence leads to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that collection would be jeopardized by delay."
[22]
Mere suspicion that collection will be jeopardized by the delay is not sufficient:
1853-9049  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.). In
, Rouleau, J. (at pp. 142-143), provided additional guidance with respect to the test set out in the former s. 225.2 which continues to be appropriate today:
"I agree with McNair, J. [in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ] when he says that the Minister can require payment of the assessment forthwith if a taxpayer may not be in a position to pay
simply because of the passage of time
allowed by the
. The amount of money involved is not significant:
what the Minister has to know is whether the taxpayer's assets can be liquidated in the meantime or be seized by other creditors and so not available to him
.
"... In my opinion, this latitude allows the Minister to rely on the exceptional provisions contained in subsection 225.2(1)
whenever, on a balance of probability, the time allowed by the taxpayer by subsection 225.1(1) would jeopardize his debt
. I emphasize on a balance of probability, not beyond all reasonable doubt. ...
"... The Minister may certainly act not only in cases of fraud or situations amounting to fraud, but also in cases
where the taxpayer may waste, liquidate or otherwise transfer his property to escape the tax authorities
: in short, to meet any situation in which a taxpayer's assets may vanish into thin air because of the passage of time. ..." (Emphasis added)
[23]
The issue before me then is whether the rights of the respondents have been offended by the manner in which the Minister availed himself of these rather extraordinary provisions and alternatively, whether the order should be struck because the Minister has failed to observe and respect the high standard of disclosure to the court that is required on ex parte applications.
[24]
There have been cases in our court in which the right to seizure, the right to enter premises, the right to affect a number of draconian measures under the
Income Tax Act
have been found to be invalid. Noteworthy is the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  N.R. 47 (F.C.A.), that Revenue Canada's use of search warrants obtained under s. 231.3 of the
Income Tax Act
violates the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. The court (at p. 5058) found that the use of the term "shall" deprived the issuing officer of any residual discretion and for that reason alone the provision ran afoul of ss. 7 and 8 of the
Charter
. Important for our purposes is that unlike s. 225.2, the court found that s. 231.3 was concerned with the detection and prosecution of crime and, therefore, "nothing less than the full panoply of
Charter
protection is appropriate". Furthermore, the constitutional validity of a particular statutory provision was in question in
and other similar cases.
[25]
Nor can I overlook the fact that the provision as it now stands has a greater safeguard than its predecessor. Under the
Income Tax Act
as amended, ss. 222 to 228 set out a variety of procedures for the collection of moneys owed to Her Majesty for taxes, interest, penalties or other charges under the
. In 1985 the
was amended and s. 225.1 was added to postpone these collection processes during the time allowed for a taxpayer to file a notice of objection with respect to the assessment or reassessment of his taxes. However, in exceptional circumstances where "it could reasonably be considered that collection of an amount assessed would be prejudiced by the delay", the Minister under the former s. 225.2 could institute collection proceedings. In 1988, the provisions were once again revised and s. 225.2 was amended to require prior authorization by a court before "jeopardy collection" procedures could be initiated. Although previously not required, the present provision requires the Minister to appear in court to avail himself of these special collection provisions if he wishes to do so before the period for filing notices of objection has expired.
[26]
To succeed, therefore, the respondents must establish the failure of the Minister to adhere to and respect the standard of disclosure. Clearly, an applicant, on an ex parte application, must exercise utmost good faith and ensure full and frank disclosure to be successful.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (B.C.S.C.), Sheppard, L.J.S.C., allowed the taxpayer's application to have a jeopardy collection order set aside because the Minister had not made full disclosure with respect to the allegations in its ex parte application.
[27]
The court must always be careful to ensure that the same standard is applied to all taxpayers irrespective of their relative wealth and irrespective of whether the taxpayer has run afoul of the law. However, as Joyal, J., observed in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D.), the nature of the assessment itself may raise a reasonable apprehension of jeopardy.
[28]
In the present case the concern expressed by the Minister was that there has been substantial income and that the income was drug-related. This turns out to have been entirely verified by cross-examination, by reply material and by subsequent events. On the balance of probabilities, delay may jeopardize the collection of the taxpayers' tax debt.
[29]
Finally in the light of other factual confirmation, the alleged deficiencies in the evidence presented by the Minister at the ex parte motion would not appear to warrant setting the order aside. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Joyal, J., dealt with the taxpayer's argument that there were serious deficiencies in the affidavit evidence submitted on behalf of the Minister and the argument that evidence, when submitted in affidavit form, must be strictly construed. He commented (at C.T.C. 278):
"The taxpayer's counsel might have an arguable point were the evidence before me limited to that particular affidavit. As counsel for the Crown reminded me, however, I am entitled to look at all the evidence contained in the other affidavits. These affidavits might also be submitted to theological dissection by anyone who is dialectically inclined but I find on the whole that those essential elements in these affidavits and in the evidence which they contain pass the well-known tests and are sufficiently demonstrated to justify the Minister's actions."
[30]
Accordingly, I conclude that the level of disclosure by the Minister was adequate, particularly since nothing was taken from the taxpayers until they had been notified of these registrations on title by the Minister.
Conclusion:
[31]
The respondents' applications are dismissed for the reasons outlined above. There will be no order as to costs.
Applications dismissed.
Editor: Steven C. McMinniman/sms
1.		Section 225.2 was originally added by 1985, c. 45, s. 116(1) and it formerly read:
"225.2(1) Notwithstanding s. 225.1, where it may reasonably be considered that collection of an amount assessed in respect of a taxpayer would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof, and the Minister has, by notice served personally or by registered letter addressed to the taxpayer and directed the taxpayer to pay forthwith the amount assessed or any part thereof, the Minister may forthwith take any of the actions described in paragraphs 225.2(1)(a) to (g) with respect to that amount or that part thereof.
"(2) Where the Minister has under subsection (1) directed a taxpayer to pay an amount forthwith, the taxpayer may
(a) upon three days notice of motion to the Deputy Attorney General of Canada, apply to a judge of a superior court having jurisdiction in the province in which the taxpayer resides or to a judge of the Federal Court of Canada for an order fixing a day (not earlier than 14 days nor later than 28 days after the date of the order) and place for the determination of the question whether the direction was justified in the circumstances;
(b) serve a copy of the order on the Deputy Attorney General of Canada within six days after the day on which it was made; and
(c) if he has proceeded as authorized by paragraph (b), apply at the appointed time and place for an order determining the question.
"(5) On the hearing of an application under paragraph (2)(c) the burden of justifying the direction is on the Minister."
2.		Essentially, s. 222 provides that all unpaid taxes are debts recoverable in the Federal Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, s. 223(2) provides that a certificate of such debt registered in the Federal Court has the same force and effect as a judgment and all proceedings may be taken thereon, and s. 158 provides that the taxpayer shall pay his assessed tax within 30 days from assessment, whether or not an objection or an appeal from the assessment is outstanding.
