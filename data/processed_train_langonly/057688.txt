: This is a motion made under rule 324 of the
Federal Court Rules
") on behalf of the defendant for an order striking out the statement of claim without leave to amend for lack of a reasonable cause of action pursuant to rule 419(1)(a) of the
The plaintiffs, Norma Elizabeth Machado, Jose Omar Machado and Milagro Ybeth Machado, were scheduled to be deported with their father Julio Machado Lovo on Monday, October 7, 1996. On October 7, 1996, they filed a statement of claim herein. (The defendant is excessively described.) The relief sought reads thus,
"(a) a Declaration that, on the facts of the case, the plaintiffs' removal will violate their s. 7 and s. 12 rights under the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and that the defendant will have thereby breached those rights;
"(b) an interim Declaration that, on the facts of this case, the plaintiffs' removal will violate their s. 7 and s. 12 rights under the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and that the defendant (sic) will have thereby breached those rights;
"(c) an interim and permanent injunction, pursuant to the common law and/or s. 24 and s. 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
or the
Proceedings Against the Crown Act
, prohibiting the execution of any departure order or deportation order either against the plaintiffs or either of their parents to El Salvador, or to any country where removal to El Salvador is a possibility."

On November 12, 1996, the defendant made the motion to strike the statement of claim. On November 26, 1996, counsel for the plaintiffs informed the Registry that she would withdraw the statement of claim. As of December 19, 1996, counsel for the plaintiff has not discontinued the claim or responded to the motion brought by the defendant.

This is a case where the plaintiffs should have proceeded via judicial review under s. 82.1(1) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2. That provision reads, thus:
"82.1(1) An application for judicial review under the Federal Court Act with respect to any decision or order made, or any matter arising from, under this Act or the rules or regulations thereunder may be commenced only with leave of a judge of the Federal Court - Trial Division."
This is the lawfully prescribed and unique means of seeking relief. The plaintiffs are seeking declaratory relief and an injunction. Section 18(3) of the
provides that the court may grant only the remedies allowed by s. 18(1) against a federal board or tribunal, in this case an injunction and declaratory relief, if the applicant proceeds by way of judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
. It follows that this court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the claim because the plaintiffs proceeded by way of statement of claim.

An eminently sensible line of cases emanating from
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), have made the same finding. In <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , Mr. Justice Nadon stated that:
"[S]ection 18(3) makes it clear that the remedies provided for in subs. (1) and (2) can only be obtained by way of a judicial review application made under s. 18.1. Consequently, any application to obtain a declaratory relief or a writ of mandamus against any federal board, commission, or other tribunal must be made pursuant to s. 18.1" (p. 33)
[6]
The line of cases relying on <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> include
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.) and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D. Protho.). Justice Cullen, in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), made a similar finding. In his opinion, "the 1992 amendments to the
were intended to establish a clear procedure for seeking, inter alia, declaratory relief in this court" (p. 170).

The relief sought by the plaintiffs could and should have been sought by judicial review under s. 82.1(1) of the
Immigration Act
. This is the only way judicial review of any decision made under the
Immigration Act
can be reviewed. The defendants' submission that if the applicants - in this case the plaintiffs - are not required to follow this procedure, the result is that they could proceed with their claim without first being granted leave. This would effectively ignore and circumvent Parliament's will. Accordingly, this court strikes the statement of claim pursuant to rule 419(1)(a) of the
, without leave to amend.
Motion allowed.
