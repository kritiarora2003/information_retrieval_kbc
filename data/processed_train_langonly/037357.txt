Giles, Associate Senior Prothonotary
: In this matter I reserved a decision on request 221B in order to satisfy myself whether an inventor being examined both as one of the inventors of the device, the subject of the patent in issue, and as an officer of a party can be asked to interpret patent not in issue of a similar device which he also invented.
[2]
The Federal Court of Appeal has indicated in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , is authority for the proposition that in certain cases an author can be asked to interpret a document (not being a contract). That is to say the author can be asked what he meant by the wording.
[3]
It is possible for an inventor not to be an expert in the field to which his patent pertains. Although in this case the inventor has been for many years in the employ of a company in the field there is no specific evidence that he is an expert in the field and is therefore perhaps not qualified to give expert evidence.
[4]
The rules specifically provide for the examination of an inventor but do not specifically qualify an inventor as an expert in the field of his invention. Notice must be taken of the practice of retaining patent agents and patent attorneys as ghosts for inventors and certainly there should be no assumption that the inventor of a patent not in issue is the "author" of that patent as that word is used in Smith Kline & French. I therefore conclude that Irish Shipping and not Smith Kline & French is the authority that I should follow in this case. It will therefore be ordered that the questions covered by requests 221B do not have to be answered.
Order accordingly.
