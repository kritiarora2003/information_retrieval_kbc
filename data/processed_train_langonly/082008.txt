Reed, J.
: The applicant seeks an order quashing a decision made pursuant to s. 70(5) of the
Immigration Act
, a decision that found him to be a danger to the public in Canada. Consequent upon that decision, his statutory right to have the deportation order that had been issued against him reviewed by the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Appeal Division) was removed. I had occasion recently to describe the effect of such a decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). I do not think it necessary to repeat that description here.
[2]
Counsel challenges two separate aspects of the decision: (1) the Minister's s. 70(5) decision was made after the Appeal Division had completed its hearing of the applicant's case but before a decision was rendered; and (2), in any event, the whole decision-making process used for s. 70(5) purposes is flawed.
After Appeal Division
Hearing Completed
[3]
With respect to the first area of challenge, the applicant was ordered deported on May 5, 1996. That order was appealed to the Appeal Division. The appeal was heard and that hearing completed on January 29, 1996. The Minister was a party to that proceeding. After the hearing was completed but before the Appeal Division rendered its decision, a s. 70(5) decision was rendered. This occurred on February 15, 1996. The Appeal Division wrote to the applicant on March 6, 1996, stating that the February 16, 1996 letter would be treated as a motion to dismiss the applicant's appeal because the Appeal Division no longer had jurisdiction over the matter. Such dismissal occurred.
[4]
Counsel challenges a s. 70(5) decision made in these circumstances, on two grounds: (1) the transitional provisions set out in the amendments to the
Immigration Act
, which came into force on July 10, 1995, do not provide for such; [see footnote 1] and (2) if they do, on their face provide for such a result, they are to that extent invalid as being an infringement of a person's right to fundamental justice guaranteed by s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
.
[5]
The first argument is one of statutory interpretation. Section 13(4)of the amending legislation provides:
"Subsection 70(5) of the Act, as enacted by subsection (3), applies to an appeal that has been made on or before the coming into force of that subsection and in respect of which the hearing has not been commenced, but a person who has made such an appeal may, within fifteen days after the person has been notified that, in the opinion of the Minister, the person constitutes a danger to the public in Canada, make an application for judicial review under section 82.1 of the Act with respect to the deportation order or conditional deportation order referred to in subsection 70(5)."
[6]
Counsel argues that s. 13(4) does not apply to remove jurisdiction from the Appeal Division when an appeal has been heard and the only remaining step in the process is the rendering of a decision by the Appeal Division. He argues that the text of s. 13(4) is ambiguous and should be interpreted in favour of the applicant. Reference was made to the very comprehensive decision in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), that when the English text is read in the light of the French text, there is no ambiguity. Mr. Justice Dubé held that the Minister did not err in rendering a s. 70(5) decision after the hearing before the Appeal Division was completed but before a decision on the appeal was rendered. The French text reads:
A question was certified in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case allowing the interpretation issue to be appealed to the Court of Appeal. If such an appeal is successful, it would be determinative of the instant case. In the absence of any decision, on the appeal, to the contrary, I accept the reasoning and result in <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[9]
Counsel's second argument on this aspect of the application is that if s. 13(4) is interpreted to allow the removal of jurisdiction from the Appeal Division, after a hearing has been completed but before a decision has been rendered, that subsection violates the guarantee of fundamental justice set out in s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. Counsel argues that such a use of s. 70(5) means that a party (the Minister) who has appeared before the tribunal and participated in that proceeding, can remove the matter under appeal from the independent tribunal, seized with making the decision, and make the decision himself. Counsel argues this is an attack on the independence of the Appeal Division and a denial of fundamental justice. He cites in support of this argument the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
, the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and the
Basic Principles on the Independency of the Judiciary
adopted by the 7th U.N. Congress on the Prevention of Crime and endorsed by the General Assembly resolutions 40/32 and 40/146. These documents are referred to for the provisions therein which state that an individual's rights and obligations are to be determined by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal. Counsel argues that when an impartial tribunal has been established for such a purpose (the Appeal Division) and, then, a government who has been a respondent in a proceeding before that tribunal takes away the jurisdiction of the tribunal and confers that jurisdiction on itself, the terms of the international documents cited have been ignored.
[10]
After hearing counsel's arguments, it came to my attention that Mr. Justice Gibson had an appeal before him that dealt with a s. 70(5) decision made after a hearing before the Appeal Division had been commenced but before a decision was rendered (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)). He held that in such circumstances it was not the s. 70(5) decision that should be challenged, but the decision of the Appeal Division dismissing the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Even though this was not argued before me, I am of the view that a careful reading of the relevant statutory provisions dictates that conclusion. I have therefore concluded that I must dismiss this aspect of the present appeal on the ground that the wrong decision has been challenged. It is the Appeal Division's decision concluding that it lacked jurisdiction that should be challenged.
Section 70(5) Procedure
[11]
With respect to the s. 70(5) procedure itself, counsel argues that that procedure is faulty because: (1) the individual is not told why he is alleged to be a danger to the public (counsel calls this the lack of linkage argument); (2) s. 70(5) grants the Minister discretionary authority to affect a significant interest of the applicant with so little guidance as to how it should be used that the subsection must be considered to be unconstitutionally vague; (3) the individual is not given an oral hearing before a decision is made; (4) the operation of a s. 70(5) decision results in a cruel and unusual punishment and is contrary to s. 12 of the
Charter
.
[12]
With respect to the second argument set out above, that based on vagueness, this argument was considered in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> decision and is now a question that has been certified for appeal. With respect to the argument that an oral hearing is required, that has been dealt with by the Federal Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Imm. L.R.(2d) 165 (F.C.A.), at 175, and it is clear that such is not required. With respect to the assertion that cruel and unusual punishment is involved in the present case, the jurisprudence seems clear that such is not the case, see
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 289, at 305 [D.L.R.] and
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.A.), at 18. Also, I note that the applicant is not a long term resident of Canada. He has been here only five years and, while the country to which he would be returned was not determined at the date of the s. 70(5) decision, he has voluntarily left and returned to Jordan.
[13]
I turn then to what counsel calls the lack of linkage argument. Counsel argues that the material sent to the applicant, as the basis for the consideration by the Minister, does not identify why the applicant might be found to be a danger to the public. He argues that the applicant, therefore, does not know what the case is that he has to meet. Secondly, he argues that the Minister's decision is made on the basis of a document that the applicant never sees and upon which he is never given an opportunity to comment (the Criminal Backlog Review Document). It is argued that the procedure being used is contrary to the principles of fundamental justice, natural justice and fairness.
[14]
Counsel for the respondent argues that the applicant knows why the Minister is being asked to consider issuing a danger to the public decision. I agree that the applicant was sent material that he was told would be put to the Minister, and by reference to which the Minister would be asked to make a decision on whether the applicant was a danger to the public. That material comprised a number of documents, e.g., his immigrant visa and record of landing, an R.C.M.P. report identifying the offences of which he had been convicted. Only two of the documents provided to the applicant contain any significant information concerning the applicant's circumstances and the nature of the offences of which he was convicted. One of these is notes of an interview, dated March 3, 1995. That interview was held to determine whether a deportation order should be issued as a consequence of the convictions. The other document is a s. 27(1) highlights report, dated March 6, 1995. That report summarizes the information relevant for the issuance of the deportation order. It is only necessary to quote from the latter since the two documents contain essentially similar information:
". . . .
THE SUBJECT STATES THAT HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF COCAINE AND HE NEEDED MONEY TO BUY MORE DRUGS. HE WAS DRIVING ON MAIN ST. WITH ANOTHER PERSON, GEORGE, WHOSE LAST NAME HE DOESN'T KNOW. THEY STOPPED AT THE PETRO CANADA GAS STATION, THE SUBJECT ENTERED THE GAS BAR STORE AND JUMPED OVER THE COUNTER. THERE WAS A CASHIER BEHIND THE COUNTER WHO MOVED ASIDE WHEN THE SUBJECT JUMPED OVER THE COUNTER. THE SUBJECT OPENED THE CASH REGISTER AND REMOVED ALL THE MONEY FROM THE DRAWER. THERE WAS A TOTAL OF $240.00. THE SUBJECT THEN RETURNED TO THE CAR. HE WAS NOT IN POSSESSION OF A WEAPON.
THE SUBJECT AND GEORGE DROVE TO NORTH PEMBINA ESSO AND ROBBED IT OF $45.00. THE SUBJECT WAS CONVICTED OF THEFT UNDER FOR THIS OFFENCE WHICH IS NOT REPORTABLE. HOWEVER, THE SUBJECT LOST HIS WALLET IN THE GAS STATION STORE. AS A RESULT THE POLICE WERE FOLLOWING THE SUBJECT IN HIS CAR ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER. IN AN EFFORT TO GET AWAY FROM THE POLICE, THE SUBJECT WAS SPEEDING IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA UNTIL HE HIT A SNOWBANK AND LOST CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE. HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO RUN AWAY ON FOOT UNTIL HE WAS APPREHENDED BY POLICE.

[15]
In response to the documentation sent to the applicant, on January 4, 1996, his counsel sent written submissions dated January 18, 1996. Counsel stated that he was at that time in the process of interviewing potential witnesses for the hearing before the Appeal Division that was scheduled for January 29, 1996. The representations sent by counsel included information concerning the three drug abuse treatment programs the applicant had successfully completed while incarcerated and the one anger management program. They also included information concerning the successful completion of a drug treatment program, run by the Salvation Army, which the applicant had taken after his release but while on parole. The submissions included letters from the applicant's fiancée, the fiancée's sister, and the applicant's brother. The applicant had been living with his fiancée since 1993 and in January 1995 she was expecting their first child (to be born in two months). The submissions also asserted that the applicant did not really have a country of origin. He was a Palestinian who had lived in Kuwait, Jordan, Israel, Turkey and Iraq. His father had gone to Kuwait at some time and was now deceased. His mother and brother were in Canada.
[16]
Part of the brother's letter reads:
"NEDAL IBRAHIM IS NOT A CRIMINAL OR DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC. NEDAL ALWAYS BEEN A HARD WORKING INDIVIDUAL. HE HELPED SUPPORTING MY POOR FAMILY SINCE HE WAS 16 YEARS OF AGE. EVEN WHEN I CAME TO CANADA ON 1981 AS A FOREIGN STUDENT. HE WAS HELPING MY FATHER SUPPORT MY COLLEGE FEES AND LIVING EXPENCES. I WOULD NOT FORGET THIS, BECAUSE I WOULD NOT BE THE WAY I AM RIGHT NOW WITHOUT HIS CONTRIBUTION. I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS AND IT IS DOING VERY WELL. NEDAL IS ONE THE FACTORS OF MY SUCCESS.
IN KUWAIT, DRUGS OR ALCOHOL ARE PROHIBITED. SO, WE NEVER SEEN IT OR USED IT.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE NIGHT OF THE ROBBERY SOME BODY OFFERED HIM SOME KIND OF DRUG. HE TOOK IT, HE WENT OUT OF HIS MIND, HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM.
THAT WAS NOT MY BOTHER WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME, THAT WAS THE COCAINE DRUG IN HIS SYSTEM.
I BLAME OUR SOCIETY FOR MAKING IT EASY TO USE AND HANDLE SUCH A SEVERE DRUG. MY BROTHER IS A DIFFERENT PERSON, A BETTER PERSON SINCE HE COMPLETED ALL THE PROGRAMS FOR REHABILITATION.
NEDAL IS LOOKING FORWARD TO START A FAMILY WITH HIS COMMON LAW WIFE, HIS ONLY HOPE NOW IS TO BE HIS WIFE AND HIS BABY THE EXPECTING IN 2 MONTHS.
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THAT AWAY FROM HIM. DO NOT SEPARATE A FATHER FROM HIS CHILD.
I BELIEVE MY BOTHER WILL MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION IN OUR COMMUNITY."
[17]
Part of the fiancée's letter reads:
"I met Nedal Feb ̍92 at a friends place. Our relationship was more friends than anything. In the fall of ̍93 our relationship became more serious, so we moved together at Weatherstone Place. We shared good times and bad times together. Nedal is a very good person, he's sensitive and hard working. Unfortunately he got involved with people who are drug users. During the time we spent together he never did any kind of drugs or consumed alcohol.
"When Nedal left jail in Spring '95 I noticed a lot of changes. He became a mature, responsible person. I also noticed a change in his daily life style. I believe we could build a life together, that's me, him, and baby. He is extremely happy to be a father, he's always making plans for us together. I'm certain Nedal will be a very good father and husband."
[18]
The significant parts of the Criminal Backlog Review Report, which serves as the foundation for the recommendation by officials of the department of Citizenship and Immigration that an opinion that the individual is a danger to the public be issued by the Minister's delegate, read:
"
DANGER TO PUBLIC ASSESSMENT
: (degree of violence involved in commission of offence(s), recidivism, remarks from police and sentencing reports, victim statements and psychiatric evaluations, etc.)
- committed robberies while under the influence of cocaine
- needed money to buy cocaine
- in an effort to get away from police, he sped through downtown, lost control of his vehicle & hit a snowbank
- he attempted to get away on foot but was apprehended by police.
- Notice was sent to subject (4.1.96) who gave same to lawyer on 18.1.96
- lawyer claims subject has turned things around considerably
- while incarcerated, subject completed programs which addressed his anger management and addiction to drugs.
- After release, believing that the courses he completed in jail were insufficient, he completed the Addictions & Rehabilitation Program offered by the Salvation Army.
- offences were committed while under the influence of crack cocaine
- lawyer asks us to consider that he went into service stations to take money from till and it was only when the attendants tried to stop him did any level of violence take place - the police described it as a 'struggle'.
- re: outstanding matters in Edmonton dating back to 1992, subject denies involvement; however, he intends to clear up the matter when he takes care of the immigration matter. Subject was advised that if he wanted to deal with the matter, he would have to enter a guilty plea. Since he denies involvement, that would not be an alternative
- subject is engaged and they are expecting their first child
- lawyer claims subject will suffer hardship if he is separated from his fiancée and expected child.
. . . . .
"
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
(If applicable, list sighnificant [sic] humanitarian and compassionate, public policy or removal risk considerations.)
- subject is engaged and they plan to marry (they are expecting their first child in two months)
- according to lawyer, subject has a brother in Canada and his father is deceased
- according to immigration report, subject's mother & two brothers are in Canada; he has five siblings in Israel
- subject fled to Jordan in 1967 (according to lawyer) - with his family, 2 presume - ended up in the Jordanian army but didn't complete his tour. He is now concerned about the consequences of not completing his tour of duty.
"
Lawyer mentions outstanding matters in Edmonton which the subject claims he will take care of after he clears up his immigration case. The Immigration 27(1) Highlights report mentions that subject has outstanding charges for trafficking in a Narcotic in Alberta. Please note, charges will not be taken into consideration when assessing the danger rationale.
Subject has convictions for very serious offences which were committed while under the influence of cocaine (lawyer's submission.) I believe subject is a danger to the public.
"
ON THE BASIS OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION, SUPPORTED BY THE ATTACHMENTS, I RECOMMEND THAT THE MINISTER'S OPINION BE REQUESTED THAT THE ABOVE NAMED IS A "DANGER TO THE PUBLIC" WITH REFERENCE TO SECTION 70 OF THE
January 29/96
I DO NOT CONCUR _____
- short-term resident
- committed serious & violent crimes to support his cocaine addiction
- refugee status not pursued by subject although subject's citizenship may be at issue.
After reviewing the file carefully, I have come to the conclusion that the decision under review must be set aside for a number of reasons. Firstly, as in the <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> case, no reasons were given for the decision that was made. In the absence of reasons there is no guarantee that the decision-maker actually considered the applicant's representations. Those representations are filtered through a first and then a second level immigration officer by way of the summary in the Criminal Backlog Review document. The identity of the actual decision-maker (the Minister's delegate) is not even known. A great deal of power is being exercised over the applicant's life without an assurance that the applicant's representations are fairly assessed.
[20]
Secondly, I accept the criticism that the decision was made by reference to documentation not provided to the applicant (the Criminal Backlog Review Report). If it contains errors the applicant has no opportunity to respond. He has no opportunity to address the colour added to the circumstance of his case by the tone in which the document is written and the details that are chosen for inclusion and those that are left out.
[21]
Thirdly, one can characterize counsel's lack of linkage argument in a number of ways. He characterized it as a failure to provide adequate notice of the case the individual has to meet. It can also be characterized at least in this case, as the making of a decision by the decision-maker without regard to the material before him (her), see s. 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Court Act
.
[22]
I am very aware of the extensive jurisprudence that holds that courts are not to review the merits of discretionary decisions of the kind in question here. I am also aware that it has been held that the Minister's delegates need not adopt any formal guidelines or policy parameters for the making of those decisions. I find it necessary, however, to review the facts as they appear on this file. The applicant came to Canada in 1991, as a permanent resident. Sometime in 1992 or 1993 he was charged with trafficking in hash. He denies that he is guilty of those charges but he did not face them. He fled from Edmonton to Winnipeg. One evening, date unknown, but some time before September 1994, he stole $250.00 from one gas bar and $45.00 from another. No weapon was involved. Although there appears to have been a physical "struggle" during one of these incidents, no one is reported as having been hurt. He drove dangerously trying to evade the police, eventually running into a snow bank. As a result of that series of related events he was convicted of robbery, theft and dangerous driving. The sentences imposed were concurrent, the most severe being a term of imprisonment for one year. While awaiting trial he was released on bail. This would have involved an assessment as to whether, if released on bail, he would be a danger to the public. That decision was clearly in the negative.
[23]
The applicant then spent approximately five months in jail. He appears to have been released by the beginning of February 1995 (the immigration officer on March 3, 1995, refers to him as having been released a month and a half earlier). The applicant was released on conditional release and his supervision apparently ended May 5, 1995. This would have involved an assessment by the Parole Board or the relevant provincial officials as to whether there was a danger that he would re-offend. That assessment must have been in the negative. There is, then, the evidence of the drug abuse programs the applicant successfully completed and his family's descriptions of him as having become a more mature and responsible individual, particularly in the light of the fact that he was soon to become a father. Lastly, on February 15, 1996, a year after he had been released from serving five months in jail, and probably close to two years [see footnote 2] after the one evening spree of criminal activity that led to his incarceration, a s. 70(5) decision is rendered declaring him to be a danger to the public in Canada.
[24]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), Mr. Justice Wetston noted that whether a person constitutes a danger to the public in Canada involves an assessment of present or future danger. There is no evidence of such a risk assessment having been made in this case to support the decision of the Minister's delegate. At the very least, in my view, a s. 70(5) decision has to be based on a risk assessment. Conviction for a serious offence alone is not sufficient.
[25]
For the reasons given the decision in question will be set aside. Counsel asked for an opportunity to make submissions with respect to the certification of a question or questions. If no representations are received by December 11, 1996, I shall assume that certification is not sought.
