: These are two applications filed pursuant to s. 44 of the
Access to Information Act

Background
[2]
In March 1988, Public Works Canada ("PWC") issued a proposal call for the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project, to construct "a fixed link" between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. In response to this call the applicant, as a participant in a joint venture, submitted a proposal in June 1988, consisting of six different volumes of documents, portions of three of which were duplicated in four other separate volumes. Subsequently, in August and September 1988, a further five volumes of documents were submitted, each described as a resubmission of a portion of the original proposal, intended to address deficiencies identified by PWC. The 15 volumes of documents are herein referred to collectively as ("the Proposal"). Each volume of the Proposal, except the last resubmission volume, contains at its beginning the following preamble on a separate page immediately prior to the Table of Contents.
"Preamble
This document is an integral part of the Proposal for the Stage II of the Northumberland Crossing Project and should be read in conjunction with all the other parts of this Proposal, as listed in the Index which follows.
The data, furnished in this document shall not be disclosed outside the Crown and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposal; provided, that if a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this data, the Crown shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the date to the extent provided in the contract. This restriction does not limit the Crown's right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction."
The last resubmission volume includes a statement similar to the second paragraph of this Preamble, with the sentence structure varied and in somewhat different order.
[3]
Some of the information included in the Proposal relates to alternative solutions proposed by the applicant, a bridge or a tunnel, but most of the information in the Proposal is concerned with the bridge solution. One other record is here in issue, an evaluation report (the "Record"), relating to the applicant's proposed tunnel solution, produced in November 1988, by a consultant hired by PWC.
[4]
Ultimately, the applicant's Proposal either for a bridge or a tunnel was not accepted by PWC and no contract was negotiated between them for a fixed link. Subsequently, in 1992, PWC advised the applicant, by two separate letters, of two requests that it had to release information concerning the fixed link project, that information in its possession appeared to concern the applicant and it provided an opportunity for the applicant to state objection to release of the information in accord with the provisions of the
The Applicant's Original Application
For Review (Court File T-916-92)
[5]
On March 3, 1992, the Access to Information Coordinator of PWC, Atlantic Region, wrote to the applicant in relation to a request received by the Department pursuant to the
for records relating to "why the idea of a tunnel was dismissed in favour of a bridge proposal as one of the options to create a fixed link between P.E.I. and the mainland". PWC advised that it had in its possession records containing information (the "Record") relating to the applicant, that this might contain information as described in s. 20(1) of the
but they did not have sufficient information to substantiate this, and as required by the
the Department intended to disclose the Record if written representation as to why the Record should not be disclosed were not received within 20 days from receipt of that notice by the applicant. Any representations made would result in a review of the Department's decision to disclose the Record.
[6]
Enclosed with the Department's letter were copies of pertinent sections of the
and a copy of the Record to which the Department's letter referred, the Record in this case consisting of the evaluation report prepared by an outside consultant for the Department and relating to the applicant's proposal for a tunnel project.
[7]
By letter of March 19, 1992, the applicant responded to the Department's letter, opposing any disclosure of the Record. In its letter of objection the applicant made specific reference to ss. 20(1) and 27(1) of the
and cited the following reasons:
In response to the applicant's letter on March 30 the Director General of the Atlantic Region of PWC wrote to advise that, notwithstanding the concerns and objections of the applicant, PWC had decided to disclose the Record relating to the applicant. By Notice of Motion dated April 21, 1992, SNC-Lavalin Inc. applied to the court pursuant to s. 44 of the
for a review of the decision made on behalf of the respondent Minister to disclose the Record in question.
The Applicant's Second Application
For Review (Court File T-1133-92)
[9]
By a second letter of March 10, 1992, from the Access to Information Coordinator, PWC Atlantic Region to the applicant, the applicant was advised that the Department had received a request for records relating to "data submitted by bridge consortiums, assessment of bridge proposals ...". The applicant was advised that PWC considered that the request related to information including the bridge Proposal submitted by the applicant in relation to the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project. While PWC believed the Proposal might contain information as described in paragraphs 20(1)(a) to (d) of the
it did not have sufficient information to substantiate this. It proposed to disclose the Proposal subject to consideration of any objection the applicant might have to that proposed course of action, which objection should be received within 20 days of the notice provided.
[10]
In response, on March 19, 1992, the same day as the response was written in relation to the Department's notice in relation to its other decision, the applicant responded, opposing disclosure of the Proposal on the grounds that
On April 9, 1992, the Director General, Atlantic Region of PWC wrote to advise that, notwithstanding the concerns and objections of the applicant, PWC had decided to disclose the applicant's Proposal.
[12]
On May 4, 1992, the solicitor for the applicant wrote, and sent his letter by fax, to the Director General, Atlantic Region of PWC, to advise that he had been instructed to apply to the Federal Court of Canada pursuant to s. 44 of the
for an order requiring that the records referred to in the letter of April 9 not be disclosed. The solicitor requested that no action be taken to disclose the material referred to until the matter is resolved by the court or by agreement of the parties, and he indicated that as soon as originating documents were filed they would be provided to the Department of Justice in Halifax. Application was then made under the
pursuant to s. 44 seeking a review of the decision that the applicant's Proposal be disclosed.
[13]
That application was not filed with the court until May 15, 1992, some 24 days after the letter of April 9, sent to the applicant by registered mail, was received by the applicant on April 21, 1992. Section 44(1) of the
"44(1) Any third party to whom the head of a government institution is required under paragraph 28(1)(b) or s. 29(1) to give a notice of a decision to disclose a record or a part thereof under this Act may, within 20 days after the notice is given, apply to the court for a review of the matter."
In view of the statutory provision the respondent submits that the application under s. 44(1) in relation to the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal was filed out of time, and for this reason the application should be dismissed.
Amended Application
The applicant filed an Amended Notice of Motion and a Supplementary Affidavit of Armand Couture in Court File T-916-92 on August 25, 1993. In its Amended Notice of Motion the applicant incorporates in its motion for a review, pursuant to s. 44 of the
, the decision in regard to "a proposal submitted by the applicant to the respondent regarding the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project", in addition to the decision of the respondent Minister to disclose the Record as to "why the idea of a tunnel was dismissed in favour of a bridge proposal as one of the options to create a fixed link between P.E.I. and the mainland", as the original Notice of Motion provided. The Amended Notice of Motion seeks the same relief and sets out the same grounds as the original Notice filed in May 1992, but it refers to the affidavit of Armand Couture sworn the 24th day of August 1993, in support of the motion. The Amended Notice of Motion is dated August 25, 1993, the same day as it was filed.
[15]
The applicant did not seek leave to amend the original Notice of Motion but simply filed the amended document with the Supplementary Affidavit of Mr. Couture. The applicant points out that the respondent did not apply to the court to challenge the applicant's amendment of the Notice of Motion.
The Issues
[16]
For the applicant the issues raised are stated as follows:
1. Are the records exempt from disclosure pursuant to s. 20(1)(c) and (d) of the
2. Is the applicant's Proposal exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
3. Is the Notice of Motion in T-1133-92 out of time?
I propose to deal with the last of these issues first, modifying the scope and description of that issue, then to deal with the other issues.
Is The Decision To Disclose The
Applicant's Proposal Properly Before
The Court In These Proceedings?
[17]
This issue, essentially a procedural one, arises because the application for review of the decision to disclose the Proposal, Court File T-1133-92, was filed on May 15, 1992, 24 days after the applicant received the decision on behalf of the Minister that, after considering submissions of the applicant, it was decided to disclose the Proposal to the requester.
[18]
The respondent urges that in view of s. 44(1), since the application was not filed within 20 days, it is out of time. No application for an extension of time was filed and it is submitted that the court has no discretion to extend the time for filing where the
providing for the process does not so provide. ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), where Mr. Justice Pinard applied this principle in relation to proceedings under s. 135(1) of the
Customs Act
, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp.), c. 1; upheld on appeal, unreported, Court File A-1148-91, December 7, 1993 (F.C.A.). See also the variation in application of the principle where the applicant, acting on his own behalf, wrote to the court within the time prescribed, indicating the intent to apply under s. 135(1) of the
Customs Act
but did not file documents to initiate action within the time prescribed, yet the Crown's motion to strike the statement of claim was dismissed:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.). That case followed
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), which was then on appeal. See also, contra,
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.), now on appeal.) Here no provision for an extension of time to file is included in the
. In these circumstances it is urged the court has no discretion to exercise and the application made May 15, 1992, in relation to the decision to disclose the Proposal must be dismissed.
[19]
Apparent late filing of an application for review under s. 44(1) of the
, was one reason, among others, expressed by Mr. Justice Strayer in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 91 (T.D.), in dismissing an application for an extension of time for service and filing, made ex parte to be dealt with in writing under rule 324 of this court's
. Strayer, J., noted that the
makes no provision for the court to extend the time specified in s. 44(1), and no authority was suggested for the court to grant an extension of time. There the application was dismissed with leave to reapply in a manner to meet the concerns of the court.
[20]
For the applicant it is urged that s. 44(1) is permissive and does not specify that an applicant must file an application for review within 20 days. The purpose of the limitation period is said to be to permit the Crown to disclose information after lapse of the 20 day period if a third party, who "may" apply for a review, has not done so. Thereafter the Crown may disclose the information in question without recourse by the third party who has not requested a review. The applicant urges, however, that if the information has not been disclosed by the time an application for review is filed, even if that be more than 20 days after communication of the decision to disclose it, the matter is still appropriate for the court to determine. In the circumstances of this case it is urged the court should review the decision. The respondent was advised by letter, within the prescribed period, that an application was to be filed under s. 44(1). The decision in question arises essentially from the same circumstances as the earlier decision, and it was made at about the same time, and here application was made to review the first decision concerning essentially similar information on the very day that the second decision, to disclose the Proposal, was received by the applicant.
[21]
In my view, the purpose of the limitation period described by the applicant may be one effect of failure to apply to the court within the prescribed period, but the purpose is broader than merely providing protection from recourse, or a reply to objections, made after 20 days by an objecting third party. The ultimate purpose of the
is to provide access to information when requested, except for specified exceptional cases, and in a timely fashion, to the requester. In view of that purpose of the
, the procedures established to deal with objections by a third party, to whom the information sought by a requester relates, must serve the purpose of providing a reasonable but limited time for the third party to object and for consideration of objections received, before a final determination about disclosure of the information. If the main purpose of the
is to be served, the time limit fixed by s. 44(1) must, in the ordinary course, be construed as it was by Strayer, J., in
, supra, that is, the time limit is to be strictly applied. The court has no discretion under the
to extend the time for filing or to consider the application filed late. Except possibly in an extraordinary case, to which I refer below, where application is made later than the 20 days limited by s. 44(1), the matter sought to be reviewed cannot be considered to be properly within the jurisdiction of the court. In my opinion, while the court may have discretion to consider the matter in an exceptional case, unless the case be truly exceptional, it will dismiss the application. Thus, I find that the application made in Court File T-1133-92, filed later than the period prescribed by s. 44(1), must be dismissed. There is no application for an extension of time and no argument that this is an exceptional case.
[22]
That is not the end of the matter as the applicant views it, for it is urged that the application in T-1133-92 is now moot anyway, since the applicant's amendment of its Notice of Motion in Court File T-916-92 includes review of the decision to disclose its Proposal. There is no question that the original Notice of Motion in T-916-92 was filed in a timely manner, though it specified only review of the decision to disclose the Record referred to in the correspondence from the Department dated March 3, 1992, that is, "records as to why the idea of tunnel was dismissed in favour of a bridge proposal as one of the options to create a fixed link between P.E.I. and the mainland". It is pointed out that the original Notice of Motion was filed April 21, the same day as the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal was received by the applicant, and that the respondent knew the applicant would seek review of that decision, and thus, was not prejudiced by the amended Notice of Motion. I agree the respondent had notice from the applicant's solicitor, by letter sent by fax on May 4, 1992, that application for review under s. 44(1) was to be undertaken, and clearly from the application in Court File T-1133-92, filed May 15, 1992, the respondent knew that the applicant sought review of the decision. Does the amendment to the Notice of Motion in T-916-92, supported by the Supplementary Affidavit of Mr. Couture, cure the defect of failing to apply within the prescribed time for review of the decision to disclose the proposal?
[23]
For the applicant it is urged that amendment of its first Notice of Motion in Court File T-916-92, is authorized by rule 421(1) of the court's
which provides:
"421(1) A party may, without leave, amend any of his pleadings at any time before any other party has pleaded thereto."
In this case no "pleading" or response was filed to the original Notice of Motion filed on April 21, 1994, and the respondent took no action pursuant to rule 422 to disallow the amendment. The latter rule provides:
"422. Where any party has amended its pleading under rule 421(1), any other party may, within two weeks after the service on him of the amended pleading, apply to the court to disallow the amendment of any part thereof, and the court may, if satisfied that the justice of the case requires it, disallow the same."
[24]
For the respondent it is urged that these rules, 421 and 422, concern pleadings in actions in the court, commenced by Statement of Claim, as defined by rule 2 which provides, in part:
"'action' means a proceeding in the Trial Division other than an appeal, an application or an originating motion, and includes such a proceeding by or against the Crown or any person acting for or on behalf of the Crown;
. . . . .
'pleading' means any document whereby an action in the Trial Division was initiated or a claim in such an action was defined, and any document, whereby a claim was defended or answered, and includes a confession of judgment and a discontinuance."
I agree that those Rules relate to actions in the court, and this proceeding by an application under s. 44(1) of the
is not an action.
[25]
I do not agree with the implication of the respondent's submission on this point, that the court, even in an appropriate case, may not allow an amendment to an application or a Notice of Motion. While the court's
have no counterparts, for applications, to rules 420 to 428 which concern amendments to pleadings in actions, rule 303 is a general provision for amendment of any document except a judgment or order. It provides:
"303(1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy, or of correcting any defect of error, the court may, at any stage of a proceeding, and after giving all interested parties an opportunity to be heard, order any document in the matter to be amended on such terms as seem just, and in such manner as it may direct.
"(2) This rule does not apply to a judgment or order."
In my view, rule 303 provides a basis for the court, in an appropriate case, to admit amendments to applications, particularly in light of rule 2(2) which sets out the general purpose of the rule as
"... intended to render effective the substantive law and to ensure that it is carried out; and they are to be so interpreted and applied as to facilitate rather than to delay or to end prematurely the normal advancement of cases."
[26]
There are no counterparts, in relation to applications or motions, for rules 424 and 427, which specifically provide for amendment of pleadings, in an action, by leave granted by the court on application for leave to amend. Leave to amend may be effective even after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of commencement of the action has expired, and notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment is to add or substitute a new cause of action, if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 573 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  C.P.R.(3d) 481, at p. 210 (F.C.A.); and see also discussion concerning the application of rules 424 and 427 in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 18-22 (T.D.), currently on appeal.
[27]
In my opinion, the absence of provision in the
for extending the time to file an application under s. 44(1) for a review of a decision to disclose information, is not an absolute bar in an appropriate case to consideration of an application filed late, or a later application to amend an application made within the prescribed time. If authority be needed for that extraordinary jurisdiction, I would find it under the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended. Section 2(1) defines "Rules" as meaning "provisions of law and rules and orders made under s. 46", and s. 46 provides in part
"46(1) Subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council ... the rules committee [appointed pursuant to s. 45.1] may make general rules and orders.
. . . . .
(c) for the effectual execution and working of any Act by or under which any jurisdiction is conferred on the court or any division of it or on any judge of the court in respect of proceedings in the court and the attainment of the intention and objects of that Act including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, a rule deeming any jurisdiction conferred on the court or a judge to have been conferred on a specified division of the court.
. . . . .
"(2) Rules and orders made under this section may extend to matters arising out of or in the course of proceedings under any Act involving practice and procedure or otherwise, for which no provision is made by that Act or any other Act but for which it is found necessary to provide in order to ensure the proper working of that Act and the better attainment of its objects."
While this case was not argued in these terms, it is my view that the absence of provision in the
Access to Information Act
for an extension of time to apply under s. 44(1), or for amendment, of an application that was filed within the time prescribed, after that time has elapsed, is not a bar to the exercise of the court's discretion to permit either course, upon application, where that is necessary "to ensure the proper working of that Act (i.e., the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1), and the better attainment of its objects". In such a case, the court acting in accord with rule 5, the so-called "gap rule", may provide for an extension of time, by analogy to what it may do in regard to a regular application for judicial review under s. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, and rule 1614. Similarly, in an appropriate case, the court may allow an amendment to the original application under s. 44(1), by analogy to the provisions set out in rules 424 and 427.
[28]
Is this a proper case for accepting the amendment of the Notice of Motion as a proper basis for considering review of the decision to disclose the Proposal, assuming the court has authority to so act? The applicant relies on its amendment, in August 1993, of the application originally filed in April 1992. No application for leave to amend was presented. The respondent objects at the time of the hearing to the amendment, and in my opinion, that objection must be upheld in the absence of any explanation of delay in filing an amended application until 15 months after the applicant knew of the decision that its Proposal was to be disclosed to the requester, and in the absence of argument that warrants considering this to be an extraordinary or exceptional case.
[29]
In my opinion, the court ought not to allow the Amended Notice of Motion, filed August 25, 1993, insofar as it relates to the matter of a review of the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal. Not having filed for review within the time prescribed by s. 44(1), that matter is not within the court's jurisdiction by reason of s. 44(1), unless the court grants leave to extend the time for filing, which was not here sought, or allows the application as amended. While it is said that the issue raised by the decision to disclose the Proposal of the applicant arises out of circumstances similar to those leading to the decision to disclose the Record, and that the respondent could not here claim to be surprised that a review was sought of the decision to disclose the Proposal, the record in this case shows that PWC made two separate decisions, each in relation to a specific request for particular information, which requests were different, one about tunnel proposals and the other about bridge proposals, and both PWC and the applicant treated the decisions separately, at least until the applicant's Amended Notice of Motion was filed. There is, moreover, no representation here made about how permitting review of the decision to disclose the Proposal would serve "to ensure the proper working of that Act [i.e., the
Access to Information Act
] and the better attainment of its objects" (The words quoted, except those in square brackets, are from s. 46(2) of the
Federal Court Act
.), particularly in light of its primary object of providing access to information, upon request, aside from exceptional cases. That would seem to me essential if the court is to be persuaded that the case is exceptional and warrants the exercise of discretion to consider the matter even though it is formally raised after the normal time for seeking a review has expired. Only if persuaded that this is the case would the court be warranted in relying on the
Federal Court Act
and the court's
to treat the case as an exception to the ordinary process set out in the
Access to Information Act
.
[30]
In this case no application to amend the Notice of Motion having been made and no persuasive argument that the case is exceptional having been advanced, I conclude the Amended Notice of Motion should be dismissed insofar as it relates to the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal.
Is The Applicant's Proposal
Confidential Information Within
Paragraph 20(1)(b) Of The Act?
[31]
In the event my conclusion is found on appeal to be in error and that the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal is properly before the court by the applicant's Amended Notice of Motion, I turn to the substantive question whether, as the applicant claims, it is information that is "confidential" within paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
, as the applicant claims. If so, it may not be disclosed.
[32]
It is the applicant's submission that its Proposal is exempt from disclosure, and the respondent should refuse to disclose it to a requesting party because it is information described in paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
which provides:
"20(1) Subject to this section, the head of a government institution shall refuse to disclose any record requested under this Act that contains
. . . . .
(b) financial, commercial, scientific or technical information that is confidential information supplied to a government institution by a third party and is treated consistently in a confidential manner by the third party. ..."
[33]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 207 (T.D.)) has established that requirements under paragraph 20(1)(b) are that the information to be exempt from disclosure must be
1) financial, commercial scientific or technical information,
3) supplied to a government institution by a third party, and
4) treated consistently in a confidential manner by the third party.
[34]
At the hearing it was accepted that the Proposal contains "financial, commercial, scientific or technical information", and that the applicant, as is attested by the affidavit of Mr. Couture, has consistently treated its Proposal in a confidential manner. Indeed, its treatment of the Proposal as confidential is said to be evident from the preamble restricting use of the information that is included in each volume of the project Proposal.
[35]
The respondent submits that paragraph 20(1)(b) cannot apply to the evaluation report because it was not supplied to PWC by the applicant, a third party, but rather by a "fourth party", a consultant retained by PWC. That does not preclude the application of this provision, in my view, for "third party" is defined by the
, s. 2, as including any party other than one that requests information or the government institution. The respondent's suggestion of a "fourth party" is merely another description for another third party under the
. The Record was clearly provided by a third party, the consultant, even though that was not the applicant, who is also a third party. I note that at the hearing the applicant did not claim the Record was exempt from disclosure under paragraph 20(1)(b), but the supplementary affidavit of Mr. Couture does describe it, as well as the Proposal, as containing "confidential, financial, commercial, scientific and technical information which has consistently been treated in a confidential manner by P.E.I. Crossing Ventures and S.N.C.-Lavalin Inc.". There is evidence from the Record itself that it was treated as confidential for on the coversheet of the Record the word Confidential is stamped in capital letters approximately ½ inch high and the word is also hand printed in capital letters, in close association with a handwritten code apparently for filing purposes or other numbering of the document. I am prepared to assume that the document was treated as confidential by the consultant, the third party who supplied the information to PWC. So treating the Record, as confidential, would be consistent with a professional consultant's responsibility, for the Record purports to be an evaluation report of a project proposal submitted by the applicant, which the applicant consistently treated as restricted from disclosure, and had so indicated in the preamble included in each volume of its Proposal, except for any use by PWC for evaluation purposes. On this basis I accept that the Record, which relates to a tunnel project, as well as the Proposal, which relates to a bridge project, is confidential information within paragraph 20(1)(b), at least in the sense that each of the third parties who submitted the information to PWC treated it as confidential.
[36]
The major difference between the parties is whether the Proposal, and the Record, is "confidential information", that is by some objective standard, as required by paragraph 20(1)(b). For the respondent it is urged that a general statement by affidavit of Mr. Couture that the Proposal is "confidential" does not make it so for purposes of the
and no other evidence is offered as to its confidential nature in an objective sense (see
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (T.D.)). Yet there is other evidence before the court, that is the information itself, sealed with the confidential affidavits of Mr. MacCoul. The Proposal, and the Record, have been reviewed by the court, bearing in mind the standard for "confidential information" within paragraph 20(1)(b) as set out in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at p. 210 (T.D.), that is,
"(a) that the content of the record be such that the information it contains is not available from sources otherwise accessible by the public or that could not be obtained by observation or independently by a member of the public acting on his own;
"(b) that the information originate and be communicated in a reasonable expectation of confidence that it will not be disclosed; and
"(c) that the information be communicated, whether ... required by law or supplied gratuitously, in a relationship between government and the party supplying it that is either a fiduciary relationship or one that is not contrary to the public interest, and which relationship will be fostered for public benefit by confidential communication."
[37]
I am satisfied that the last two of these requirements are met. The Proposal originated and was communicated to PWC in a reasonable expectation of confidence that it would not be disclosed. That is what the applicant's preamble to each volume of the Proposal clearly indicated, unless the Proposal resulted in a contract, in which event use or disclosure of the information was to be governed by the contract. In addition, the Proposal was submitted in response to a call for proposals in relation to a specified major public work project. The relationship of the applicant and PWC as tenderer and receiver of a project proposal was consistent with the public interest and that relationship in the ordinary course was fostered for public benefit by confidential communication, at least up until the time the contract was awarded, or the project abandoned by PWC. Treating the information as confidential at least to that time serves the public benefit, ensuring competitive bidding in regard to engineering, management, workmanship and pricing proposed for the project. If the Proposal meets those requirements, the Record, which is an evaluation of part of the applicant's alternative proposals, must be accepted as meeting those requirements as well.
[38]
Whether those same factors are as relevant at the time the request is made for access to the information, may be questioned. After proposals submitted in a public tender process are considered and contracts awarded or the process abandoned, the public interest may well dictate disclosure of tender bids, if sought. Aside from that question, a key issue is whether the Proposal or the Record are confidential in the sense of the first element set out in
Air  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the information available from sources, other than the applicant, that are otherwise accessible to the public.
[39]
I am not satisfied that all of the information in the Proposal was available only from the applicant and not from sources otherwise accessible to the public. Some of the information, it seems to me, may qualify as confidential in that it would not be available from sources otherwise accessible by the public, but other portions of the information are of the sort that may be accessible to the public aside from the proposals submitted by the applicant. I deal with this matter further, in considering severability, below.
Are The Record And The Proposal
Of The Act?
[40]
The applicant urges that both the Record and the Proposal are exempt from disclosure under paragraphs 20(1)(c) and 20(1)(d) of the
. Those provisions are:
"20(1) Subject to this section, the head of a government institution shall refuse to disclose any record requested under this Act that contains
. . . . .
(c) information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in material financial loss or gain to, or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of, a third party; or
(d) information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with contractual or other negotiations of a third party."
[41]
The applicant acknowledges that it has the burden of establishing grounds for exemption from disclosure and that, in relation to paragraphs 20(1)(c) and 20(1)(d), it must demonstrate a reasonable expectation of probable harm, as set out by the Court of Appeal in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 246; 26 C.P.R.(3d) 407 (F.C.A.), and in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(4th) 315 (F.C.A.).
[42]
For the applicant it is urged, on the basis of the statements sworn by Mr. Couture, and from examination of both the Record and the Proposal that the court should conclude that the detailed information in the Proposal, regarding finances, construction techniques, and logistics the applicant proposed for the project if it were successful in its bid, would, if disclosed, result in material financial loss or prejudice to the applicant, and in interference with its contractual negotiations in the future. Disclosure of the Record, the evaluation report, it is urged, would harm the applicant's reputation and compromise its chances of obtaining future contracts for similar work, as sworn by Mr. Couture.
[43]
Having examined the Record and the Proposal, it is not self-evident to me from the documents themselves that the applicant, whatever may be its concerns, has demonstrated a basis for "a reasonable expectation of probable harm". That is the standard enunciated and applied by Mr. Justice MacGuigan in
Canada  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . The applicant does not demonstrate probable harm as a reasonable expectation from disclosure of the Record and the Proposal simply by affirming by affidavit that disclosure "would undoubtedly result in material financial loss and prejudice" to the applicant or would "undoubtedly interfere with contractual and other negotiations of SNC-Lavalin in future business dealings". These affirmations are the very findings the court must make if paragraphs 20(1)(c) and (d) are to apply. Without further explanation based on evidence that establishes those outcomes are reasonably probable, the court is left to speculate and has no basis to find the harm necessary to support application of these provisions.
[44]
Thus, I conclude that the Record and the Proposal are not exempt from disclosure pursuant to either paragraph 20(1)(c) or paragraph 20(1)(d) of the
Severability
[45]
As indicated earlier, upon examination of the Proposal it is my view that portions of it are exempt from disclosure in accord with paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
and other portions are not so exempt. The respondent has an obligation, pursuant to s. 25 of the
to disclose any part of the Proposal that does not contain, and can reasonably be severed from any part that does contain, information described in paragraph 20(1)(b) that he is required to refuse to disclose. Section 25 of the
"25. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where a request is made to a government institution for access to a record that the head of the institution is authorized to refuse to disclose under this Act by reason of information or other material contained in the record, the head of the institution shall disclose any part of the record that does not contain, and can reasonably be severed from any part that contains, any such information or material."
[46]
The application of the principle of severability and of s. 25 was not addressed in argument by counsel. The only portion of the proposal specifically referred to by the applicant, a volume in its Proposal that contains financial information, was referred to primarily as illustrative of the material in the Proposal that is exempt from disclosure under paragraph 20(1)(b) and not to suggest that other portions might be disclosed. Essentially the applicant's position is that the entire Proposal consists of confidential, financial, commercial, scientific or technical information and the full Proposal is exempt from disclosure. Essentially the respondent's position is that there is no evidence that the information in the Proposal is confidential in nature, thus the whole Proposal should be released.
[47]
Both positions, in my view, are unreasonable. For example, in my opinion some information in the Proposal is clearly not exempt from disclosure because on its face it is not confidential information within paragraph 20(1)(b). Thus, for example, the Proposal includes considerable printed material from other sources which can hardly be described as confidential, e.g., the published financial statements of partners in the venture which were both publicly owned corporations, summary reviews of other projects in which the applicant was previously involved, summaries of experience and curriculum vitae of those who would provide leadership if the project were to proceed. But aside from that kind of information, other portions, especially of the financial aspects of the proposal would appear clearly to be confidential within paragraph 20(1)(b) and s. 20 imposes a responsibility on the respondent to refuse to disclose that. This responsibility is not discharged by saying to the third party who may be affected by disclosure "Here is information that relates to you. It may contain information that should not be disclosed but I will release it as requested unless you prove by evidence satisfactory to me (or to a court on an application to review) that the information ought not to be disclosed under the
". While it is true that on review under s. 44(1) the burden is on the applicant seeking to restrain disclosure, the actual responsibility to refuse to disclose the information under s. 20 is that of the head of the institution, in this case the respondent. In my opinion that responsibility has been taken too lightly in this case.
[48]
Two issues arise in relation to the application of s. 25. First, what portions of the information are exempt in accord with paragraph 20(1)(b)? Second, is the balance of the information, that is the portion not exempt, reasonably severable? In the latter regard one must bear in mind that "... Disconnected snippets of releasable information taken from otherwise exempt passages are not ... reasonably severable", and severance of exempt and nonexempt portions should be attempted only when the result is a reasonable fulfilment of the purposes of the
, per Jerome, A.C.J., in
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 558-559 (T.D.). Where severance would result in release of minimal portions of the information in question and would result only in release of information otherwise available from published public sources, or where the information left to be released is not a reasonable response to the request for information in light of the portions exempt, severance has been found not to be reasonable, and thus not required within s. 25 (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at pp. 7-8 (T.D.)).
[49]
The applicant clearly expressed particular concern, through counsel at the hearing and by references within the Proposal itself, that the financial information was to be treated as confidential. I note that financial statements of the applicant, which was not then a public company, were said to be included in a sealed envelope with the volume devoted to financial information, to be used only for the evaluation of the applicant's proposal and not to be made public under any circumstances. Whether by coincidence or good management those particular statements of Lavalin Inc., to which the applicant SNC-Lavalin Inc. is successor, are not included in the sealed Proposal documents provided to the court under the confidential affidavit of Mr. MacCoul. Those statements, said to have been submitted to PWC in a sealed envelope, which, until persuaded otherwise, I infer are confidential under paragraph 20(1)(b), may not be disclosed under the
for the process established by the
for their possible disclosure has not been followed by the respondent.
[50]
As for the balance of the volume containing financial information, it consists of information essentially of three sorts: first, a verbal description of the financial plan contemplated for the project if the applicant's proposal, either for a bridge or for a tunnel, were accepted; second, letters of intent and commitment from financial partners in the venture and from an insurance broker; and third, the financial reports, of the applicant, submitted separately in a sealed envelope, and of its two financial partners, in both cases public and published annual reports of operations. In the covering letter of June 13, 1988, under which the original proposal was submitted, the following statement appears:
"In view of the confidential nature of part of the Financial documentation, we have chosen to place that complete section into a separate Volume 5. Thus Volume 5 applies to both Bridge and Tunnel Options."
In the Index to the Proposal as a whole I note that only volume 5 containing the Financial Plan, is described as "(Confidential)". While the restrictive statement included in each volume of its proposal does purport to restrict disclosure and use of the information contained in each volume, volume 5 concerning the financial plan does seem to have been specially treated by the applicant, specifically as confidential. I am prepared to find that, aside from the published financial and annual reports of associated public companies, it does qualify as confidential financial information within paragraph 20(1)(b). That volume is Exhibit "E" to the confidential affidavit of Mr. MacCoul filed in Court File T-1133-92. The same finding in my opinion, should apply to Exhibit "N" to that affidavit which is a volume, a Resubmission, in relation to the Financial Plan. Both Exhibits "E" and "N", aside from published financial reports of associated companies, contain information concerning financial commitments of other companies, not merely of the applicant, and they include information relating directly or indirectly to the confidential financial status of the applicant. In my opinion, that information is exempt from disclosure and ought to have been exempted by the respondent.
[51]
As for the balance of the information in the Proposal I draw no conclusion that it should be exempt from disclosure. Insofar as it is original text, charts and drawings related to this project, there may be matters the applicant considers would warrant special consideration by the respondent, accepting the latter's obligation to release any information that can reasonably be severed from exempt information. Perhaps if an appeal is contemplated in this matter, counsel for the parties might confer about any portions of the information in question the disclosure of which particularly concerns the applicant. Fruitful discussion and possible agreement on limited portions that are exempt from disclosure might even avoid necessity for any appeal. Indeed, such discussions in advance of these proceedings might have resulted in a shared view of the application of the law concerning disclosure of information relating to third parties, and avoidance of any necessity for application to the court.
[52]
I turn briefly to the Record, here in question, the evaluation report in relation to the applicant's Proposal for a tunnel project. Having reviewed that Record, I would describe it as a series of evaluations, assessing what is said to be the applicant's tunnel proposal against criteria, apparently established by PWC for particular aspects of the Proposal. Overall the assessments may not be seen as flattering to the applicant and I have no doubt the applicant would contest many aspects of the assessment. Nevertheless, there is nothing on the face of the Record that would lead one to conclude any of the information included in it is confidential by any objective measure. I note the Record does not relate to the applicant's financial plan for its project.
Conclusion
[53]
For the reasons set out, the following are my conclusions in relation to these two applications.
[54]
The application in Court File T-1133-92 to review the decision to disclose the applicant's project Proposal, is dismissed. The application was filed later than the time prescribed by s. 44(1) of the
and no application is made to extend the time for filing.
[55]
The Amended Notice of Motion in Court File T-916-92 is dismissed:
(a) insofar as it incorporates an application to review the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal because the court is not persuaded that any ground is here established to treat the circumstances as an exceptional case warranting exercise of any discretion the court may have to consider the matter when not raised by filing application within the time limited by s. 44(1), and
(b) insofar as it includes review of the Record, the application does not establish that its disclosure would lead to a reasonable expectation of probable harm to the applicant under paragraphs 20(1)(c) and 20(1)(d), and the Record does not contain confidential information within paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
If I should be found in error in declining to exercise any discretion the court may have to review the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal, then in my view portions of that Proposal as indicated in these Reasons, identified as Exhibits "E" and "N" to the confidential affidavit of MacCoul, sworn October 18, 1993 (Court File T-1133-92), except for published financial or annual statements of public companies associated with the applicant in the joint venture, should be considered exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph 20(1)(b). The balance of the Proposal, not being information that is confidential in nature, by any objective standard, should be released as reasonably severable.
[57]
Costs were requested by the respondent. My conclusions support the position adopted by the respondent Minister, in part on procedural grounds. If on appeal I were to be found in error on procedural grounds, that in my view preclude review by the court of the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal, as indicated I would have ordered that a portion of the Proposal, mainly the volumes relating to the applicant's financial plan, were exempt from disclosure under paragraph 20(1)(b). In these circumstances, it seems to me each party should bear its own costs.
[58]
I direct that a copy of these Reasons be filed in each of Court Files T-916-92 and T-1133-92.
Application dismissed.
