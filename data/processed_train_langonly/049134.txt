Ferenc Lakatos, Ferencne Lakatos and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  for judicial review of a decision rendered on January 20, 2010, by a pre-removal risk assessment officer (PRRA officer). The application was submitted under subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27, by Ferenc Lakatos, Ferencn√© Lakatos and Sandos Lakatos (the applicants). The PRRA officer found that the applicants were not subject to a danger of torture or to a risk of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment or to a risk to their lives if they were to be removed to their country of nationality.

The applicants are citizens of Hungary of Roma ethnicity.

On March 9, 2010, after the decision by the PRRA officer and before their application for leave and judicial review of the decision could be considered, the applicants left Canada for Hungary. These facts were admitted by counsel for the applicants.

Consequently, I am forced to agree with the respondent that this application for judicial review has become moot and must therefore be dismissed. In so doing, I rely on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in

Accordingly, the application for judicial review is dismissed.
The application for judicial review of the decision rendered on January 20, 2010, by a PRRA officer is dismissed.
