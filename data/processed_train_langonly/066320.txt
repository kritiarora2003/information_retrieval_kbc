O'Reilly, J.
: After initially being turned down for a survivor's pension under the Canada Pension Plan, Ms. Mona Pelland was found to be eligible by a Review Tribunal. In turn, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development asked the Pension Appeal Board (PAB) for leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision. A member of the PAB denied the Minister's request.
[2]
The Minister argues that the PAB erred in two respects: first, by applying the wrong legal test and, second, by unreasonably denying leave to appeal. The Minister asks me to overturn the PAB decision and order another member to reconsider the leave application. I am satisfied that the PAB erred and will, therefore, allow this application for judicial review.
[3]
The two issues are:
1. Did the PAB apply the wrong legal test for deciding an application for leave to appeal?
2. Was the PAB's decision to deny leave unreasonable?
I. Factual Background
[4]
Beginning sometime in the late 1980s, Ms. Pelland lived with Mr. Colin Sinclair in Churchill, Manitoba. Mr. Sinclair faced a number of health issues, including diabetes, cirrhosis and kidney disease. In the late 1990s, he began receiving medical treatments in Thompson and Winnipeg because facilities were lacking in Churchill. By 2002, Mr. Sinclair was receiving frequent dialysis treatments and moved to Winnipeg to be closer to medical facilities. In 2004, Mr. Sinclair died in hospital.
[5]
Ms. Pelland applied for a survivor's pension in 2004. In her application and other supporting materials, she indicated that she and Mr. Sinclair had separated sometime in the mid-1990s (various dates were provided). The Minister concluded that she was not eligible for a survivor's pension under the
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-6, because she was no longer living in a common law relationship with Mr. Sinclair during the twelve months prior to his death. Ms. Pelland asked to have that decision reconsidered. The Minister did not change his mind.
[6]
Ms. Pelland appealed the Minister's decision to the Review Tribunal. The Review Tribunal allowed her appeal on the basis that Ms. Pelland and Mr. Sinclair continued to be in a common law relationship at the time of his death, even though they were no longer living together as a result of Mr. Sinclair's medical circumstances.
[7]
The Minister sought leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision to the Pension Appeal Board. A member of the PAB denied leave. The member noted that the existence of a common law relationship between Ms. Pelland and Mr. Sinclair was "undisputed". Further, he found that the Minister had not "established" that the Review Tribunal had erred in fact or law. Therefore, there was "no reasonable chance of success on appeal."
II. Did the PAB apply the wrong legal test?
[8]
On a leave application, the PAB must determine whether there is some arguable ground on which the appeal might succeed. It should not decide whether the applicant could actually succeed.
[9]
These propositions are set out in a series of cases:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 173 F.T.R. 102 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 252 N.R. 141 ( <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 190 F.T.R. 114 (T.D.).
[10]
Here, in my view, the PAB applied too high a standard. It noted that the Minister had not "established" an error on the part of the Review Tribunal. It then concluded that there was "no reasonable chance of success". Both statements disclose standards that exceed the threshold of an "arguable case" and, accordingly, I must conclude that the member erred in law in applying them.
III. Was the PAB's decision to deny leave unreasonable?
[11]
The Minister argues that the law and the evidence presented to the PAB should have resulted in a grant of leave to appeal. The decision to deny leave, then, was unreasonable.
[12]
The Minister points first to the statutory rules relating to the eligibility of a common law spouse for a survivor's pension. A "survivor" includes a person who was the common law partner of the deceased at the time of death. A "common law partner" is a person who was cohabiting in a conjugal relationship with the deceased at the time of death and had cohabited for a continuous period of at least a year (see s. 44(1), s. 42, and s. 2(1), set out in the Annex).
[13]
The Minister argues that these rules preclude Ms. Pelland from qualifying for a survivor's pension because she had not been living with Mr. Sinclair for at least two years prior to his death. In fact, the evidence showed that they may have separated much earlier than that. The Minister contends that, at the very least, the question whether Ms. Pelland fell within the rules of eligibility for a survivor's pension presented an "arguable ground on which the appeal might succeed". Accordingly, the Minister submits that the PAB's statement that the existence of a common law relationship at the time of death was "undisputed", as well as its decision to deny leave, were unreasonable. Clearly, the issue was very much disputed before the Review Tribunal.
[14]
In my view, the question whether there is an arguable issue is for the PAB to decide. Because, as I have concluded above, the PAB has not yet answered that question, I am not prepared to find that the decision to deny leave was unreasonable. Given the PAB's error of law, the proper outcome of this judicial review is to send the case back to another member of the PAB to review the Minister's submissions and decide the leave application according to the proper test.
IV. Conclusion
[15]
In light of the legal error by the PAB, another member should review the Minister's submissions and determine whether they disclose an arguable ground on which the Minister's appeal might succeed. There is no order relating to costs.
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that
1. The application for judicial review is allowed.
2. Another member of the Pension Appeal Board shall reconsider the Minister's application for leave to appeal.
3. There is no order relating to costs.
Application allowed.
