O'Reilly, J.
: The respondent Fairmont Resort Properties Inc. (FRP) brought an application under s. 12 of the
Canadian Business Corporations Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (relevant enactments are set out in an Annex) requesting the Director of Corporations Canada to order the applicants, Fairmont Hotels Inc. and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc. (collectively, FH) to change their corporate names because of the risk of confusion. Given that there are ongoing trademark disputes between the parties, both in Federal Court and before the Trademarks Opposition Board, FH asked the Director to stay FRP's application pending the outcome of those other proceedings. The Director refused.
[2]
FH seeks judicial review of the Director's decision refusing a stay. It asks the Court to overturn the Director's decision and order the Director not to take further action until the parties' trademark disputes have been decided. The respondent Director of Corporations Canada chose not to appear or make submissions.
[3]
In my view, FH is seeking judicial review of an interlocutory decision and there are no special circumstances that would justify the Court's intervention. Therefore, I must dismiss this application for judicial review.
1. Is the Director's decision refusing a stay of proceedings subject to judicial review?
2. If so, what standard of review applies?
[4]
Given my conclusion that the Director's decision is not reviewable, I need not consider the second issue.
Factual background
[5]
The parties are completely separate entities, with different histories operating in different spheres (the applicants own and manage a chain of hotels, while the respondent runs a time-share business). Yet, they have common ties to Fairmont Hot Springs, British Columbia, specifically to the Fairmont Hot Springs Resort (FHSR). In addition to its trademarks for "Fairmont", FH acquired FHSR's trademarks in 2000 and then licensed them back to FHSR. FRP used to operate FHSR's time share operations, but is no longer affiliated with it. However, FRP obtained FHSR's permission to use the word "Fairmont" in its corporate name in 1985.
[6]
FRP has begun three different trademark proceedings against FH. In 2000 and 2001, FRP challenged two of the marks FH had acquired from FHSR (before the Trademarks Opposition Board). In June 2005, it commenced a challenge to FH's word and design marks for "Fairmont" in the Federal Court (under s. 57 of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13). All of these proceedings are currently ongoing.
[7]
In July 2005, FRP began the proceedings in issue here - under s. 12 of the
CBCA
. It asked the Director of Corporations Canada to order FH to change its corporate name on grounds of confusion. In turn, in September 2005, the Director asked FH to respond, explained that FH should address particular issues relating to its operations and corporate history, and specified that its evidence should be presented in the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration.
[8]
In November 2005, FH asked the Director to stay the
CBCA
proceedings. It suggested that a stay was appropriate given that it was the registered owner of the trademark "Fairmont" - the alleged source of confusion - and its entitlement to that mark was under challenge in the trademark proceedings. In addition, it submitted that the parallel processes could result in conflicting decisions or absurd consequences, from which FH would suffer irreparable harm. In March 2006, FH's request for a stay was denied and it now seeks judicial review.
Judicial review of interlocutory decisions
[9]
Generally speaking, interlocutory rulings by decision-makers are not subject to appeal or judicial review. Courts are concerned not to permit parties to unduly delay or segment proceedings, or drive up the costs of litigation unnecessarily. Further, they are naturally reluctant to rule on procedural or administrative matters that may turn out to be superfluous or insignificant when the dispute is decided on the merits, or where an adequate alternative remedy is available at that point:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 295 F.T.R. 116; 2006 FC 715.
[10]
On the other hand, courts have also recognized that there are special circumstances where early intervention by an appellate or reviewing court is appropriate. It would be unfair, for example, to refuse to intervene when the underlying decision denies a party the benefit of a fair hearing, discloses grounds for an apprehension of bias, or curtails a party's substantive rights:
, above, at para. 15. Similarly, where the tribunal wrongly exceeded or circumscribed its jurisdiction, or declined to exercise it, early judicial intervention may be appropriate although, even in this area, courts should be cautious:
Prince Rupert Grain Ltd.
Are there special circumstances here?
[11]
FH argues that special circumstances exist in this case that merit the Court's early intervention. In particular, FH argues that the Director's decision not to grant a stay has the following implications:
- The Director's decision to deal with FRP's application while the trademark proceedings are ongoing indicates that the Director plans to arrive at a decision without taking account of FH's ownership of the "Fairmont" trademarks.
- In the absence of consideration of FH's trademarks, the only other factor that the Director could evaluate would be the respective dates of incorporation of the parties. FRP was incorporated before the applicants, so the Director will undoubtedly allow FRP's application.
- In any case, the issue of confusion cannot be resolved within FRP's application because the alleged confusion arises primarily from use of the word "Fairmont" for which FH has a registered trademark. FH's entitlement to use that mark can only be resolved in the trademark proceedings, not in FRP's application under the
CBCA
. Therefore, the Director is simply not in a position to decide FRP's application.
- If the Director grants FRP's application, FH will be in the strange position of having to remove the word "Fairmont" from its corporate name while still being entitled to use the "Fairmont" trademark. This will cause FH irreparable harm and actually cause greater confusion among members of the public.
[12]
In my view, FH's position is speculative. Under the
CBCA
, the Director may order a company to change its corporate name if that name is prohibited. Under the
Canada Business Corporations Regulations 2001
, SOR/2001-512, s. 25, a corporate name is prohibited if it is confusing, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the distinctiveness of a trademark, the length of time it has been used, the nature of the business associated with the mark, the resemblance between the corporate name and the trademark, and the territorial area in which the corporate name and trademark are used.
[13]
It appears to me that the Director must take account of all of the relevant circumstances, including FH's trademarks and its exclusive rights to use those marks in association with its business (according to s. 19 of the
Trade-marks Act
). In addition, the Director may consider all of the other factors and potential consequences about which FH is concerned, as well as the corporate history and operations of both parties. I cannot conclude from the Director's decision not to stay FRP's application that the result is a foregone conclusion to FH's detriment. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there exist special circumstances that would justify the Court's reviewing the Director's interlocutory decision. I agree with the approach taken by Justice Walsh in similar circumstances:
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 53 F.T.R. 133, (T.D.).
The application for judicial review is dismissed with costs.
THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT IS THAT:
1. The application for judicial review is dismissed with costs.
Application dismissed.
