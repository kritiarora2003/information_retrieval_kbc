Federal Court
January 21, 2009.
Anthony Karkar, for the applicant;
Steve Bell, for the respondent.
Solicitors of Record:
Anthony Karkar, Montreal, Quebec, for the applicant;
John H. Sims, Q.C., Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, for the respondent.
Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary. This case was originally cited as [2009] F.T.R. TBEd. FE.028.
As stated by this Court in numerous occasions, " last minute" motions for stays force the respondent to respond without adequate preparation, do not facilitate the work of this Court and are not in the interest of justice. A stay is an extraordinary procedure which deserves thorough and thoughtful consideration (
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.C.W.S. (3d) 642).

[20] The discretion that a Removal officer may exercise is very limited, and in any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed. In deciding when it is "reasonably practicable" for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to travelling, and perhaps in cases of long-standing applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved.
