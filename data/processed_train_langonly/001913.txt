Strayer, J.
: This is an action for a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to enjoy their respective benefits in relation to inventions described in Canadian patent numbers 1,045,142 and 949,967, free and clear of any compulsory licence under section 41(4) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4. These declarations are sought on the basis that: the section is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada; the section is inoperative as being inconsistent with the provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960, c. 44; and is null and void as being contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as enacted by the Canada Act 1982 (U.K. c. 11). The individual plaintiffs are inventors of the two inventions covered by these patents. The plaintiff Smith, Kline & French Laboratories Limited is a United Kingdom company by which they are employed and to which they assigned all their rights in the inventions. This company owns the Canadian patents in question. Smith, Kline & French Canada Ltd. is a Canadian company. As licencee it sells the medicine covered by the patent, whose generic name is Cimetidine but which is sold by Smith, Kline & French as Tagamet, a prescription drug used in the treatment of stomach ulcers. Both companies are "part of the Smith, Kline world-wide" group of companies", both being wholly-owned subsidiaries of a U.S. company which is in turn the subsidiary of Smith, Kline, Beckman Corporation, another U.S. company. Cimetidine is now the subject of several compulsory licences in Canada issued pursuant to section 41(4).
In order that the relevance of certain facts which I will set out below may be understood, it is necessary to consider first the principal issues raised in this action. This in turn requires that the provisions of section 41(4) of the Patent Act be set out. These are as follows:
"41(4) Where, in the case of any patent for an invention intended or capable of being used for medicine or for the preparation or production of medicine, an application is made by any person for a licence to do one or more of the following things as specified in the application, namely:
(a) where the invention is a process, to use the invention for the preparation or production of medicine, import any medicine in the preparation or production of which the invention has been used or sell any medicine in the preparation or production of which the invention has been used, or
(b) where the invention is other than a process, to import, make, use or sell the invention for medicine or for the preparation or production of medicine,
the Commissioner shall grant to the applicant a licence to do the things specified in the application except such, if any, of those things in respect of which he sees good reason not to grant such a licence; and, in settling the terms of the licence and fixing the amount of royalty or other consideration payable, the Commissioner shall have regard to the desirability of making the medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the patentee due reward for the research leading to the invention and for such other factors as may be prescribed."
The validity and applicability of this section are attacked on the following grounds.
[3]
Distribution of powers
- It is contended by the plaintiff that in pith and substance this subsection is a law in relation to "property and civil rights", a matter assigned to the provinces by section 92 head 13 of the Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict., c. 3 (U.K.), and not in relation to "patents of invention and discovery", assigned to Parliament under section 91 head 22 of that Act. The essential contention here is that the purpose and effect of the legislation is to regulate the price of drugs sold in Canada and that the regulation of prices is a provincial matter.
[4]
Canadian Bill of Rights - It is contended that section 41(4) is inconsistent with either or both of paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. These provide as follows:
"1. It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,
(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;
(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;"
It is said that section 41(4) takes away the "property" of the patentee of a medical patent by conferring the essential benefits of that patent on a compulsory licencee; that "due process" is denied because the procedure lacks fairness, and in substance the result is confiscatory because adequate compensation is not provided to the patentee. It is said that holders of medical patents are denied "equality before the law" because they are treated differently from all other patentees by thus being denied the exclusivity of their invention which other patentees enjoy for a period of seventeen years.
[5]
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms - It is contended that the plaintiffs are denied rights guaranteed to them by section 7 and section 15(1) of the Charter. These provisions are as follows:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
"15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability."
With respect to section 7, it is contended that the plaintiffs have been deprived of "liberty" or "security of the person" which are said to include economic liberties such as freedom of contract, this denial having occurred without regard for principles of fundamental justice. The procedural and substantive denials of fundamental justice are said to be of the same nature as those involved in the alleged denial of due process in respect of paragraph 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The discrimination complained of in respect of section 15(1) is similar to that complained of in respect of paragraph 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, although of course the language of the Charter provision is much broader and may proscribe legislative distinctions of a kind previously upheld in respect of the Canadian Bill of Rights.
[6]
The defendant generally rejects each of the above contentions. In particular he contends, inter alia, that the corporate plaintiffs are not entitled to protection under these provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. With respect to paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, and section 15(1) of the Charter, since these provisions specifically are applicable only to the "individual", it is said that they do not protect corporations. With respect to section 7 of the Charter, it is contended that although that section applies to "everyone" which may potentially include a body corporate, the rights of "life, liberty and security of the person" are not by their nature rights pertaining to a corporation.
[7]
In approaching these issues it must be recognized that section 41(4), as will be noted below, has been in effect in its present form since 1969, a period of some sixteen years, and in an earlier form raising most of the same issues, since 1923. In both its earlier and present forms, it has been the subject of much litigation as to its interpretation and even as to its constitutionality. It has been specifically acknowledged to be within the jurisdiction of Parliament on at least three previous occasions by appellate courts. While a new element has been introduced with the advent of the Charter and the coming into force as recently as April, 1985 of section 15 thereof, and while extensive evidence as to the purpose and effect of the section has been introduced in this action which was not apparently available to the courts in earlier cases, it must be underlined that it is not a clean slate upon which I write.
Facts
[8]
The essential features of section 41(4) of the Patent Act were first adopted as law in Canada in 1923 by the Patent Act of that year, 13-14 Geo. V, c. 23, being apparently patterned on British law as it then was. Section 17 of that Act provided that one could not obtain a "product" patent for food or medicine produced by chemical processes, that is for the substance itself, but only for the process by which it was made. It was also provided that with respect to any process patents for the production of food or medicine the Commissioner of Patents "shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary ..." grant a compulsory licence to anyone applying for same. In settling the terms for such licence the Commissioner was to have regard to exactly the same factors as are now prescribed in section 41(4), namely
"... the desirability of making the food or medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention."
An important limitation on the scope of such compulsory licences was that they could only be given to authorize "the preparation or production of food or medicine but not otherwise ...". That is, compulsory licences could be granted for manufacturing in Canada but not for importation of food or medicine where the process for the production of such food or medicine was the subject of a Canadian patent. It should also be noted that the prohibition on product patents with respect to food and medicine applied only to "substances prepared or produced by chemical processes" although the compulsory licensing provisions applied to all inventions "intended for or capable of being used for the preparation or production of food or medicine".
[9]
This law was reviewed by at least three appointed commissions and a parliamentary committee prior to its amendment in 1969. In 1960, the Royal Commission on Patents, Copyright and Industrial Designs, known as the Ilsley Commission, recommended retaining the system of compulsory licensing with respect to food and medicine. In 1963 the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, after reviewing the law and other material such as the Ilsley Report, recommended doing away altogether with drug patents. In 1964 the Royal Commission on Health Services, chaired by the Honourable E.M. Hall, recommended that the compulsory licensing system be extended to authorize the importation of drugs whose processes for production are patented in Canada. This recommendation was endorsed by a Parliamentary Committee, the Special Committee on Drug Costs and Prices, in 1967, subject to proper safeguards being provided to assure safety of such drugs. The Patent Act was subsequently amended in 1969 by Stats. Can. 1968-69, c. 49, to its present form. Section 41(3) was limited to compulsory licensing for processes used in the production of food. The new subsection (4) was added to provide for compulsory licensing with respect to any patents "for medicine or for the preparation of production of medicine", such licences being available not only for the production and sale of such medicine but also for its importation into Canada. Thus compulsory licensing for importation of drugs patented in Canada was first introduced.
[10]
It would appear that this amendment has had a dramatic impact on the use of compulsory licensing. For example, the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission reported in 1963 that during the first forty years of compulsory licensing, from 1923 to 1963, only 23 applications for such licences were made. Evidence was presented to me, however, that since the 1969 amendment nearly 700 such licences have been granted.
[11]
Considerable evidence was presented with respect to the manner in which licence applications are handled. It seems clear that few, if any, applications are ever refused, although some are withdrawn. With respect to the royalty fixed by the Commissioner of Patents, while before 1969 there were a few instances of higher royalties being set, since that time a total royalty of 4% has been fixed in all cases. This means, where several patentees are involved, that the 4% may be divided among them but no instance was brought to my attention where a total royalty of other than 4% had been fixed since 1969. Extensive rules have been made by the Governor in Council, pursuant to the authority granted in section 41(14) of the Patent Act, with respect to the procedure for dealing with such applications. While this procedure requires that the patentee receive notice of the application and have an opportunity to file a statement in opposition, there is no provision for cross-examination on the affidavit submitted with the original application nor is there any requirement that the Commissioner grant the patentee an oral hearing. Normally no such hearing takes place. These procedures have been considered in numerous cases in this court which will be referred to later.
[12]
Considerable evidence was presented as to the effects of this legislation. This also will be considered further at a later point but may be summarized here. In doing so it is necessary to refer to certain interlocutory proceedings taken in this case prior to trial wherein, because of disputes over what information was relevant for purposes of discovery, this court has of necessity defined more precisely the issues and thereby determined the nature of the evidence that would be relevant.
[13]
In an order dated July 6, 1982, Addy, J., gave certain directions with respect to the reattendance for examination for discovery of the representative of the defendant. In the course of dealing with the kinds of questions which the defendant's representative would have to answer, he held that the manner in which a law is administered or applied can have no relevancy to the determination of the issue of whether or not the law rendered inoperative by reason of the Bill of Rights since that is a pure question of law. He also held that factual evidence is admissible to show the intent and effect of legislation for the purpose of determining its constitutional validity. He held that such evidence could include legislative history and surrounding conditions of the impugned legislation, but not statements of a minister, other politicians, civil servants or members of the public "as to what they considered to be the object and purpose of legislation". He also held that evidence as to how a law is being administered is admissible to show the effect of the legislation. This decision was reported in, 29 C.P.C. 117, and was not appealed.
[14]
In a subsequent decision dated July 26, 1984, on a further interlocutory motion with respect to examination for discovery, I held that the only issues in the case with respect to which evidence would be admissible would be those involving the constitutional validity of section 41(4). In this respect I pointed out that in their pleadings the plaintiffs might have contended that the section was invalid as applied to them, but they did not do so. Instead their pleadings had to be taken as an allegation that the general effect of the subsection was one which was beyond the competence of Parliament to achieve. I held that this would make admissible evidence as to the effect of the section on the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, but that evidence as to the effects on individual companies, though admissible, would be of only "marginal relevance" as to the effects on the industry as a whole. This decision was reported at 1 C.P.R.(3d) 268. It was appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal which in an order dated January 11, 1985, varied my order with respect to certain documents which the Court of Appeal decided should be produced, but I do not understand the decision of the Court of Appeal to have altered in any way my conclusions as to the issues upon which evidence was admissible.
[15]
It should also be noted that since these decisions the Supreme Court of Canada issued a judgment on April 24, 1985, in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  A.R. 161; [1985] 3 W.W.R. 481; 18 C.C.C.(3d) 385; 18 D.L.R.(4th) 321. At page 106 N.R. Dickson, J., writing for the majority of the court, had this to say concerning the role of "purpose" and "effect" in the determination of the validity of statutes:
"In short, I agree with the respondent that the legislation's purpose is the initial test of constitutional validity and its effects are to be considered when the law under review has passed or, at least, has purportedly passed the purpose test. If the legislation fails the purpose test, there is no need to consider further its effects, since it has already been demonstrated to be invalid. Thus, if a law with a valid purpose interferes by its impact, with rights or freedoms, a litigant could still argue the effects of the legislation as a means to defeat its applicability and possibly its validity. In short, the effects test will only be necessary to defeat legislation with valid purpose; effects can never be relied upon to save legislation with an invalid purpose."
In that case the court was considering the question of whether the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. L-13, infringed the right to freedom of conscience and religion as guaranteed by the Charter. Dickson, J., explains at page 105 N.R. that he is using the terms "purpose and effect" to mean respectively the legislation's "object and its ultimate impact". While I would take it that "object" might be ascertained from an examination of its apprehended effect - this to be gleaned in part from an examination of surrounding facts - it could also be gleaned from an examination of the text itself which could disclose invalidity simply by the choice of criteria which would trigger the operation of the impugned law. Thus, the court held that the Lord's Day Act, by fixing the Christian sabbath as a mandatory holiday, was employing religious criteria which on their face offended the guarantee of freedom of conscience and religion in the Charter. Consistently with the passage quoted above, this "object" being invalid it was not necessary to consider whether the general effect of the legislation was secular rather than religious. It may be that the "object" of legislation, used in this sense, is really only another form of apprehended effect. Nevertheless, the case, while confirming the admissibility of evidence of effect in cases involving constitutional validity, clearly indicates that the defect in the legislation may be so apparent that extrinsic evidence as to effect is not relevant in particular cases.
[16]
While I shall be dealing later with the "object" of section 41(4) of the Patent Act as derived from the text of the section itself, I have concluded that there is ample evidence that the apprehended effect and the actual effect of the legislation was and is to bring about a reduction in drug prices, particularly in those of prescription drugs, by means of enhanced competition. In broad terms there is really no dispute between the parties as to the effect, intended or real, of the section. Apart from the reports, referred to above, of Commissions and a Parliamentary Committee which preceded the adoption of the 1969 amendment, there was submitted to me numerous interdepartmental and intradepartmental memoranda of the Government of Canada and the minutes of an interdepartmental committee, all of which indicate that in the development of the proposal for this amendment an abiding preoccupation was the promotion of competition, and thus reduction of prices, with respect to prescription drugs. The Interdepartmental Committee on Drugs, referred to above, was chaired by the Director of Investigation and Research under the Combines Investigation Act. It reported to the Minister of Justice on April 9, 1965. It had been asked to study the recommendations of the Restrictive Trade Practice Commission and of the Hall Commission, both referred to above, and to advise the Minister on those recommendations. The Committee reported in part as follows:
"According to the Reports of the two Commissions, one of the principal reasons for high drug prices in Canada is the control exercised over the manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs in Canada through patents. This control, in conjunction with high effective tariff protection and conditions peculiar to the industry (such as the fact that certain drugs may be sold only on prescription where the patient has no choice as to the product he will purchase and the fact that the sale of drugs is necessarily rigidly controlled to assure public safety), results in a serious lessening of price competition in the sale of drugs subject to patents. We consider that an essential ingredient of any plan of encouraging price competition in the sale of drugs covered by patents is to allow import of such drugs, including finished dosage forms, to enter the market through compulsory licensing."
The Committee so recommended to the Minister. It is apparent from the documentation that there was a certain nexus between the recommendations of this Committee and the orientation of the Parliamentary Committee (the "Harley Committee") which made a similar recommendation in 1967. From the report of that Committee it is apparent that the Committee had before it information which led it to conclude, inter alia, that the profits of pharmaceutical companies in Canada were about twice as high as the level of profits of the manufacturing industry as a whole, that Canadian drug prices "were among the highest of certain selected countries" and that "the price of drugs in Canada is at least higher than it need be". It was against this background that the legislation was recommended and subsequently adopted. Such facts were referred to when second reading was given to a bill incorporating this amendment on February 12, 1968. The then Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs provided tables of comparative prices of drugs in Canada and elsewhere. These tables were derived from the Harley Committee studies and were incorporated in Hansard (see House of Commons Debates, February 12, 1968 at 6616-6621). It is obvious that these price differentials were the principal motivation for the legislation. The bill introduced at that time did not pass before dissolution of that Parliament, but was reintroduced later in the year. The speech of the Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs on October 17, 1968, on second reading referred to the same evidence in explanation and support of the bill (see House of Commons Debates, October 17, 1968, at 1509 ff.).
[17]
Counsel for the defendant objected to the admissibility of the above internal memoranda, and statements by ministers, on the basis of the conclusion of Addy, J., on the interlocutory motion referred to above that "statements of a Minister of the Crown or statements of politicians, civil servants or members of the public as to what they consider to be the object and purpose of legislation are not admissible". Counsel also adopted the authorities referred to by Addy, J. I took under reserve the objections of counsel for the defendant but have concluded that this material is admissible to assist in establishing the effect rather than the purpose of the legislation. I would underline, however, that some of the evidence is of such little weight as to be virtually useless: this would include documents such as memoranda passing among civil servants expressing opinions on the work of their colleagues, or letters from ministers to other members of Parliament or members of the public explaining the reasons for legislation. Such materials have very little relevance to establishing effect and in some cases they must be regarded as lacking in weight because of the possible self-serving nature of the circumstances. To the extent however that any of these documents include data of which I am entitled to take judicial notice, it appears to me that they are admissible both with respect of establishing the "object" (in the sense of apprehended effect) and possibly the real "effect" of the legislation. In this sense they are not merely statements of opinion of the sort which Addy, J., held herein not to be admissible.
[18]
A great deal of evidence was presented at the trial with respect to the effect of the legislation. Much of that which was presented by the plaintiff related to the effects on particular pharmaceutical companies and, for reasons stated above, I can only regard this evidence as of limited probative value in respect of what I have earlier held to be the issue to which extrinsic evidence is relevant in this case, namely the general effect of the legislation on the pharmaceutical industry in Canada and abroad. Such evidence as there is on general effect, though limited, is that the legislation has had a deleterious effect on the revenues of patentees or "originators" of prescription drugs and has had a beneficial effect on the companies which have obtained and exploited compulsory licences thereunder, the so-called "generics". The evidence presented by the plaintiffs with respect to the effects on particular "originator" companies is consistent with and corroborates the evidence of general effect.
[19]
While I do not think it necessary to deal in great detail with the evidence of effect, I shall indicate such findings as I have concluded could and should be made, and shall also indicate some areas where it has not been possible for me to make any finding.
[20]
It should be noted at the outset that, according to the evidence, most if not all patentees in Canada of compulsory licenced drugs are subsidiaries or affiliates of multinational pharmaceutical corporations. Very little research and development work is done in Canada by patentees in this field, other than for the purpose of clinical testing, etc. to get the drug approved for sale here. Most of such work is done in the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and France. This was also true before 1969. Allocation and recovery of costs of such research depends on inter-corporate arrangements which were not revealed by the evidence.
[21]
I shall first deal with the cost of research and development in the field of ethical drugs, that is drugs which are not sold over the counter but which either require a prescription or the approval of a pharmacist for sale. The plaintiffs were emphatic in assuring me that it is impossible to calculate the cost of research and development for any given drug. Their witnesses corroborated this at every opportunity. Even with respect to the drug Cimetidine which is based on the two patents that are the subject of the declaration being sought in this case, the plaintiffs were unable to specify the cost of research. Their statement of claim merely said that it was a result of "more than ten years of intensive research costing tens of millions of dollars". The evidence of Dr. Ganellin, one of the plaintiffs and one of the inventors, was that it took twelve years from the beginning of research to the commencement of marketing of Cimetidine by Smith, Kline & French Laboratories Limited of the United Kingdom.
[22]
The plaintiffs called an expert witness, Professor Prafulla Joglekar, a Professor of Management at La Salle University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to describe certain estimates he had made of the profitability and risks of research and development in pharmaceuticals. The data he used as to costs and time involved in the development of New Chemical Entities (NCE's) came from an article or book chapter written by one R.W. Hansen and published in 1979. It appears that Hansen's data came from a survey he did of U.S. drug companies with respect to research and development in the United States. It appears that questionnaires were returned by 14 out of 25 firms approached and Doctor Joglekar estimated that those 14 firms provided data with respect to some 60 drugs, it being the choice of the companies as to the drugs on which they would provide research and development data. From this data Professor Joglekar has estimated, inter alia, that on average an originator of a NCE would spend some twenty-one million dollars U.S. (in 1976 dollars) after taxes for each marketable NCE. This means that in calculating the average there would be included amounts spent on unsuccessful research and development. From this data he concludes that the "average NCE" recovers its noncapitalized costs in the twenty-first year after research and development begins, and that it breaks even as an investment with an equivalent investment in corporate bonds only in the twenty-fourth year after research and development begins. It is to be noted that these are said to be estimates of world-wide research and development costs and returns, and apart from the fact that they are based in certain respects on U.S. data they depend on a number of assumptions on such matters as costs, inflation, and the policies of dozens of countries where drugs are marketed.
[23]
Another expert witness called by the plaintiffs was Professor Donald N. Thompson, a Professor of Administrative Studies at York University in Toronto. On the basis of Dr. Joglekar's estimate of an average cost of twenty-one million dollars U.S. (in 1976 dollars) for research and development for an NCE, he estimated that the costs on average in 1985 dollars would be in excess of one hundred million dollars U.S. before coming to market.
[24]
The only other meaningful evidence presented to me as to the cost of pharmaceutical research and development was the testimony of Thomas B. Dyson, a Chartered Accountant and expert witness called on behalf of the defendant. Using financial statements which the plaintiffs were obliged to produce during examination for discovery, but on a confidential basis, he estimated the cost incurred by the Smith, Kline & French family of companies in the United Kingdom (where the drug was developed) and in Canada (where csots were incurred to obtain approval for sale of the drug) for research and development with respect to Cimetidine. As the financial statements did not provide a breakdown of research and development costs incurred specifically with respect to Cimetidine, he had to assume that all their research and development costs in the U.K. and most such costs in Canada in the relevant years were attributable to Cimetidine. This at least gave me some idea of the maximum costs so attributable.
[25]
With respect to the impact of compulsory licensing in Canada on the pharmaceutical industry here and abroad, the evidence was also far from conclusive. Some of the evidence of representatives of patent-holding pharmaceutical companies was very impressionistic or anecdotal: they told of decisions taken by their companies not to invest in Canada, not to build factories, not to employ or to lay off research and production staff, all because of the 1969 amendment. It was often hard to understand the logical connection between the introduction of compulsory licences for imports and the decisions taken. Their evidence demonstrated, at best, a series of isolated effects on particular companies with respect to particular drugs. It was agreed on all sides that the market for prescription drugs is quite inelastic. That is, the quantity sold is affected very little by the price at which the drug is sold. This is partly due to the fact that most physicians, in prescribing drugs, have very little information as to the cost of the drug. Nor are they inclined to prescribe drugs more readily or in larger quantities if the price of the drug goes down. It is also true that a high percentage (some 85% according to the evidence) of Canadians enjoy some sort of drug insurance or supply programme which also makes them insensitive to the cost of drugs. Therefore, according to industry witnesses, as the generic companies obtain compulsory licences and enter the market, the originator company which is the patentee loses virtually an equivalent market share. It may also lose by being forced to lower its prices to compete with the generics which, according to the witnesses for patentees, have very few research and development costs and therefore can sell the licenced drug to druggists and hospitals for much less than can the patentee. Evidence was presented as to the volume of sales lost to generics where a particular drug had been compulsorily licenced to such generic company. In some cases these sales losses ran as high as, for example, a loss of 80% from 1970 to 1983 or a loss of 72% from 1980 to 1983. The plaintiffs showed a loss to the generic companies of almost 50% of their sales of a compulsorily licenced drug in the course of one year.
[26]
Professor Thompson in his study examined 15 drugs (some of these, it emerged from the evidence, were no longer under patent) under compulsory licences and calculated the volume loss and price loss suffered by the patentees during one quarter of 1984. His "median case" showed a volume loss of 48% and a price loss of 40%. Taking these figures as representative he estimated that the net present value to the originator of Canadian sales of such a drug would be reduced through compulsory licensing by 44% of the original value. It is to be noted that he assessed an average period of exclusivity for the originator of a compulsorily licenced drug of only four years, a figure which is not borne out by the evidence as discussed below.
[27]
While not accepting all of this evidence in detail, the defendant does not dispute the fact that patentees subjected to compulsory licences have in many cases suffered a reduction in market share and price.
[28]
An area of uncertainty which is important in assessing the impact on patentees is the length of the period of exclusivity which a patentee enjoys in the market prior to a compulsorily licenced generic version of the drug entering the market. While I heard a good deal of conflicting evidence on this question, that which appears to me to be the most reliable and pertinent was given by Micheline Ho, Chief of the Product Regulation Division, Bureau of Non-prescription Drugs, Department of National Health and Welfare. Her division is responsible for receiving reports from the drug industry as to when particular drugs are first marketed. She did an analysis (see Exhibit D-132) of some 82 drugs which are presently the subject of compulsory licensing in Canada. She calculated, for those drugs where a generic product has been marketed that the average period between the first marketing by the patentee and the first marketing by the generic company has been 6.8 years. That is, the patentee enjoys an exclusive market for its drug for, on the average, a period of 6.8 years. (It is interesting to note that the Harley Committee in 1967, on the assumption that patentees would enjoy exclusivity for about five years, recommended the amendment which was made in 1969 to allow importation under compulsory licences). This average period of exclusivity is of course far short of the 17 years which the Patent Act normally grants to patentees.
[29]
From the foregoing I conclude that there is a prejudicial effect from compulsory licensing on patentees with respect to sales and profitability in Canada of the particular drug which is the subject of the compulsory licence. I am unable to conclude from the evidence that such prejudicial effect is prohibitive in the sense of rendering unprofitable in Canada the sale of its patented drug by the patentee. One would have to know a great deal more about the economics of the pharmaceutical industry, and particularly the interrelationships among subsidiaries of the multi-national corporations which dominate this field. For example, it emerged from evidence that one Canadian subsidiary, of a foreign originator company holding a Canadian patent, purchases the patented drug which it sells in Canada from an off-shore fellow subsidiary company. It was calculated by an expert witness that if this company had been acquiring its drug at the international market price, rather than at the higher price it pays to its fellow subsidiary (the latter price not being negotiated) it would have, by its sales in Canada alone during a two year period, earned an amount in excess of the research and development costs for this drug of it and the originator company. As for the plaintiffs, they were unable or unwilling to provide any specific information of the effects on the profits of the two corporate plaintiffs or their related corporations in the United States, of the compulsory licensing of Cimetidine in Canada. At best I can only surmise that the profits of the Canadian company were significantly reduced by the compulsory licensing of Cimetidine and that those of the British company, Smith, Kline & French Laboratories Limited, were affected through loss of royalties otherwise payable to it under voluntary licences.
[30]
There was, however, cogent evidence presented by expert witnesses for the defendant to the effect that the overall profitability of the Canadian pharmaceutical industry has not been affected negatively by compulsory licensing, and that indeed the industry is very healthy in comparison to other sectors of the economy. It is recognized that there have been negative effects on certain patentees subjected to compulsory licensing and positive effects on generic companies. Yet generic companies have hardly been put in a dominant position: their sales of compulsory licenced drugs amounted in 1983 to only 3% of the sale of all pharmaceutical products in Canada, and to only 20% of total sales of all ethical drugs sold in Canada (i.e. those not available over the counter). Evidence to this effect, which I accept, was given by Professor Rod D. Fraser, Dean of Arts and Science at Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, and formerly Research Director for the Commission of Inquiry on the Pharmaceutical Industry chaired by Professor Harry C. Eastman. The Eastman Commission was appointed in April, 1984, by the Governor in Council "to inquire into and report upon the current situation in the pharmaceutical industry in Canada". It reported to the Governor General on February 28, 1985. Professor Fraser adopted as his view as an economist the conclusions of the report with respect to the effect of compulsory licensing under section 41(4) of the Patent Act. Following are some excerpts from the summary of that report:
"Sales of the 70 compulsorily licenced drugs in Canada amounted to $328 million out of a total of $1.6 billion for all ethical drugs in 1983 or 20 per cent of total sales. The generic firms that hold compulsory licences have not supplanted the patent-holding firms in the market for licenced drugs. Indeed, generic firms sold and paid royalties on 32 of the 70 drugs on which compulsory licences had been issued. Their sales of these drugs were $46 million or 21 per cent by value of total sales of $217 million of these compulsorily licenced drugs, the remaining 79 per cent being accounted for by the patent-holding firms' brand name products. The 21 per cent generic share translates to approximately 34 per cent by volume of the market in compulsorily licenced drugs when account is taken that prices charged by generic firms are half those of patentees. The sales of compulsorily licenced drugs by generic firms amounted to three per cent of the sale of all pharmaceutical products in Canada. The 24 other patented products on which compulsory licences had been issued by 1983 had sales of $111 million by patent-holding firms, but none yet by generic firms.
"Generic firms sell drugs other than those that are under compulsory licence. Their sales of all pharmaceutical products are about eight per cent of the value of total pharmaceutical sales in Canada.
"Generic firms have been more active in some therapeutic categories than in others. In 1983, they held 13 per cent of sales of anti-infective agents and from six to nine per cent of the sales in five other of the 19 therapeutic classes according to the Commission's survey of the biggest firms in Canada.
. . . . .
"Aggregate data for the pharmaceutical industry in Canada does not show adverse effects from the introduction of compulsory licensing to import in 1969. The overall profitability of firms in the pharmaceutical industry in Canada measured by their after tax profit on capital employed for the years 1968 to 1982 is more stable than for most industries in Canada and rises in the later years of the period. The profits of the industry are also substantially higher than those for total manufacturing and for most industries. Profits after taxes on equity in Canada have been lower over this period than in the United States and profits in the United States have been more stable. However, Canadian profits have risen relative to those in the United States since 1978. Thus, compulsory licensing has had no visible effect on the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry in Canada. It has adversely affected the profits of particular firms, but this effect has been compensated by the high profits of others.
"Neither does the growth of the industry reflect adverse effect from compulsory licensing. The value of shipments of pharmaceuticals in 1969 was .766 per cent of the value of shipments of total manufacturing. In 1983, the proportion was .894 per cent, but there had been lower levels between those two dates. The value of shipments can be corrected for price changes, but the pharmaceutical price index is suspected of understating the inflation that occurred in pharmaceutical prices so that the very high 'real' rate of growth for pharmaceuticals shown by such a calculation is probably excessive. An alternative measure of real output is employment, which grew as a proportion of total manufacturing from .74 per cent to .91 per cent between 1967 and 1982. The growth in the industry in Canada is not dominated by the growth of the generic sector. In 1969 the number of employees in the industry was 12,645, few of whom were in generic firms. In 1982, the employment was 15,707 of whom approximately 1,300 were employees of generic firms.
"The indices of growth can be compared to those in the United States. Value measures show a substantially greater rate of growth in Canada than in the United States. This includes value added in manufacturing, value of shipments, and wages and salaries. But changes in values are even less reliable to interpret changes between the two countries than they are for inter-industry comparisons within Canada. Turning to employment, it turns out that total employment in Canada between 1967 and 1982 rose by 28.8 per cent whereas in the United States it grew 22.6 per cent; the number of production employees in Canada rose by 29.9 per cent and in the United States by 13.2 per cent. Compulsory licensing has not had a discernible negative impact on the profitability and rate of growth of the pharmaceutical industry in Canada as a whole."
According to Dr. Fraser the multinational pharmaceutical industry is not in fact a high risk enterprise. While investment in the development of individual drugs is risky in the sense that many do not prove to be profitable, the risk is spread significantly and within the pool of drugs controlled by the typical multi-national corporation there are enough "winners" to make the total enterprise quite profitable.
[31]
Similar evidence was given by Professor Douglas Hartle, Professor of Economics of the University of Toronto. In preparing his opinion for presentation in this case he did not examine the Canadian pharmaceutical industry in isolation, but examined the performance of that industry in comparison to the performance of the Canadian manufacturing sector as a whole, and then in turn compared that relationship to the relationship between the performance of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry as a whole and the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole. This study covered the period 1965 to 1982, the last year for which comparable statistics were available in both countries. While there was some question raised at the trial with respect to the comparability of the U.S. and Canadian statistics, I am satisfied that they are sufficiently comparable to provide a clear picture of the trends in the respective industries. In brief, by most indicators the Canadian pharmaceutical industry on the basis of this comparison has done as well or nearly as well in relation to the Canadian manufacturing sector as the U.S. pharmaceutical industry with respect to the U.S. manufacturing sector. In one respect, profits on capital employed, the Canadian pharmaceutical industry has since 1973 consistently enjoyed higher profits on the basis of such comparison than has the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. In one respect only has the performance of the Canadian industry been significantly weaker, namely expenditures and employment in the area of research and development. While I accept Professor Hartle's conclusions, it must be kept in mind that the last data he used was for 1982 and the situation could have changed somewhat since that time. It must also be kept in mind that he is treating the Canadian pharmaceutical industry as a whole without distinction as between the patentees and the generic companies. He recognizes that there has been a certain shift of market, and presumably profitability, from certain patentees to certain generic companies although he does conclude that
"Among the top 10 companies in terms of total sales in 1982, three, including Smith, Kline & French had increased their market shares substantially from 1977 despite the fact that they were subject to one or more effective compulsory licences during that period."
He also notes that "none of the major companies holding compulsory licences ranked higher than 21 in terms of total industry sales in 1982". These latter conclusions as to the relative positions of patentees and generics would presumably be more susceptible to change since 1982 than would the position of the industry as a whole.
[32]
From this evidence I conclude that the effect of compulsory licensing has not been deleterious to the Canadian pharmaceutical industry as a whole.
[33]
What the effects of compulsory licensing may have been on the multinational pharmaceutical industry is seemingly impossible to say. The consumption of patent drugs in Canada is less than 2% of the international consumption relevant to our purposes. Although it appears that Canada may be the only developed country with a patent regime for drugs along the lines of section 41(4) of the Patent Act, it is clear that many other countries have laws and policies which are designed to affect the economics of drug marketing.
[34]
Much of this evidence, of course, is presumably relevant to the question of whether the normal 4% royalty which the Commissioner of Patents requires compulsory licencees to pay to patentees is compensatory. Because of the paucity of data on research and development or production costs in the industry, either generally or in particular, there is no basis upon which I can reach a conclusion on this matter. Nor do I know for example, what percentage of total international research and development costs of a drug ought to be borne by Canadian sales; nor what period of sales exclusivity in Canada is required for an originator to get a fair return on his investment, nor to what degree if any compulsory licensing in Canada makes Canadian or multi-national operations unprofitable rather than simply less profitable. The economic model espoused by Dr. Joglekar is hypothetical, is international in its perspective and based on data whose representativeness may be fairly questioned. It does not address actual market conditions as they are found in Canada. Dr. Thompson's empirical studies of sales of licenced drugs in Canada is more germane but still does not answer these specific questions.
[35]
Such evidence as there is with respect to royalties paid under "voluntary licences", i.e. those freely negotiated between the patentee and a licencee, is also inconclusive. While there was evidence of royalties under such licences being as high as 10-15%, there is also evidence of such royalties being as low as 4%, precisely the amount fixed by the Commissioner. Indeed the confidential information provided on discovery by the corporate plaintiffs themselves indicates that in certain circumstances they enter into royalty arrangements which are not substantially more favourable. I can therefore make no finding on the adequacy of the 4% royalty other than my general conclusion above that the profits of some patentees have been prejudicially affected notwithstanding the receipt of such royalties. There is, of course, another aspect to the propriety of the 4% royalty prescribed by the Commissioner: that is, whether the uniform fixing of a 4% royalty in every case is a proper exercise of the power given to the Commissioner under section 41(4) of the Patent Act. That will be considered later in the judgment.
[36]
Other evidence of effect of section 41(4) is more clear. Two separate empirical studies have demonstrated that one effect of compulsory licensing has been to reduce the cost of drugs sold to hospitals and to drug stores. The Plet study (put in evidence by the plaintiffs) an internal study done by the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs in 1977, concluded that in 1975 the average prices of compulsorily licenced drugs were 28.6% below what they would have been without compulsory licensing. The Eastman Royal Commission reporting in 1985 concluded that in 1983 the price savings through compulsory licensing totalled some $211 million. Total actual sales of such drugs were, in that year, $217 million, with the result that the calculated saving was almost 50% of what the total cost would otherwise have been.
[37]
Before leaving the facts I should make a further comment on the admissibility of evidence. I received certain evidence under reserve, noting the objections of counsel. Part of such evidence included the intra-governmental documents, ministerial correspondence and speeches which preceded the 1969 amendment. As noted above I generally regard these as admissible but entitled to very little weight. The other body of evidence taken under reserve was the testimony and affidavit of Edward Armitage, formerly Comptroller-General of the United Kingdom Patent Office. Counsel for the defendant objected to this evidence in its entirety and challenged the witness' qualifications. I do not accept his evidence interpreting Canadian law, as this is a matter for argument, not evidence. Nor can he testify as to how the Canadian law is administered. I have concluded that he was qualified to give certain of the evidence as outlined in his affidavit, as to British law. As I understand the authorities, it is not absolutely necessary that one be a legal practitioner of the country in question in order to testify as to its law, if by the office he has held he has had to become familiar with that law. Clearly Mr. Armitage in some twenty-eight years in the Patent Office had the need and ample opportunity to become acquainted with the patent law of the United Kingdom. The legislative texts which he has provided showing different stages of development in British patent law is material of which a Canadian court is in any event entitled to take judicial notice and would normally be accepted in argument without hesitation. I do not regard as relevant any of his observations as to the reasons for various changes in British legislation nor as to the administration of that legislation by the United Kingdom Patent Office. I fail to see how evidence as to the manner in which the United Kingdom Patent Office thinks it appropriate to administer its law, which since 1949 has been different from Canadian law, is relevant to the constitutional validity of the Canadian law. It might conceivably have been relevant had an issue been raised under section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms but this has not been done. I have admitted only a few observations by Mr. Armitage on the costs of research as shown in U.K. reported cases, as evidence of some relevance to the general conditions of the industry. I have marked his affidavit accordingly, putting a line through all the rejected evidence.
Conclusions
[38]
Distribution of Powers
- The plaintiffs contend that section 41(4) of the Patent Act is legislation in relation to property and civil rights in the province, hence is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada being a matter assigned to the provinces under section 92 head 13 of the Constitution Act, 1867. As I understand it, this argument has two aspects. First, it is said that this law is essentially one for the regulation of prices of prescription drugs and that any regulation of prices is presumptively a provincial matter. It is said to be in relation to a particular trade or business and therefore beyond the control of Parliament: that it interferes with contract rights by enabling the Commissioner to dictate a contract between the patentee and the licencee without the consent of the former at least. It is also contended that this involves a taking away of property of the patentee: that by its inherent nature a patent once issued confers a monopoly on the patentee for the duration of the patent. Authority was cited to demonstrate the nature of the so-called "bargain" between the state and the inventor whereby the inventor agrees to divulge the details of his invention, for the ultimate public use and benefit, and to work his invention where appropriate, in return for the grant of a monopoly of the exploitation of his invention for the duration of the patent. It is said that Parliament can attach conditions to the grant of the patent such as those referred to in sections 66 and 67 of the Patent Act, and that in case of a breach of condition through abuse of the patent certain benefits may be denied. But section 41(4) is distinguished from true conditions because, according to the plaintiffs, it takes away from the patentee (whose rights have already vested), without any proof of abuse being necessary, his exclusive rights to exploit the patent for seventeen years and confers an equal right on any licencee who wishes to exploit the patent. The effect is greatly to reduce the value of the patentee's rights because he is forced to compete with others using his invention. In effect a share of the finite market for prescription drugs is transferred from the patentee without his consent and without adequate compensation. It is said that this cannot even be characterized as taking private property for a public purpose because private property here is being transferred to another private individual or company who is the recipient of a windfall (having few research and development or promotional expenses in respect of the drug) at the expense of the patentee.
[39]
Consistently with what was said by Dickson, J., in the Big M case supra I have examined first the object of the legislation and then its impact. The object may be ascertained, in my view, by examining both the text of the legislation itself and evidence as to surrounding facts which may elucidate the object or apprehended effect. In assessing impact one may look at extrinsic evidence as to the actual effect of the legislation.
[40]
With respect to the stated purpose of the legislation, it appears to me clear from a section itself that Parliament's object was to deny a monopoly with respect to inventions of medicine or of processes for the preparation or production of medicine where there is a willing applicant who seeks a licence to manufacture in Canada, or import into Canada, or sell in Canada, the same medicine. The section requires that in such circumstances the Commissioner "shall" grant a licence unless "he sees good reason not to grant such a licence". Thus there is a presumption created in favour of the grant of the licence. The object of the section is further elucidated by its provisions with respect to the terms of the licence to be settled by the Commissioner. He is directed to "have regard to the desirability of making the medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the patentee due reward for the research leading to the invention and for such other factors as may be prescribed". (Apparently no other factors have been prescribed). In summary, therefore, the apparent object is to make such compulsory licences readily available, and on terms which emphasize a lowering of price of the drug with some consideration of compensation for the patentee with respect only to its research leading to the particular invention.
[41]
It is my view, and counsel for the plaintiffs did not disagree, that for the purposes of distribution of powers there is no significant difference between section 41(4), first adopted in its present form in 1969, and section 41(3), first adopted in substance in 1923. The main significant difference between the two sections is that section 41(4) permits licences for importation of medicines whereas section 41(3) authorizes compulsory licences with respect to patented processes for the preparation or production of food, the licence to authorize only such preparation or production and not importation. The presumption in favour of granting the licence and the factors to be taken into account by the Commissioner in fixing its terms are identical in the two sections.
[42]
The purpose or object of section 41(3), as derived from its wording, has been stated authoritatively several times. For example in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  said:
"... In my view, the objective of the provision is to bring about competition. On balance, in most fields, competition is regarded by Parliament as being in the public interest because competition regulates prices in the public interest and also because competition tends to bring about greater efficiency, better service, and further research. The monopoly granted to an inventor is an exception to this general principle in our law. Section 41(3) was passed because, in the field to which it applies, 'the specific public interest in free competition' was deemed to be more important than the maintenance of the patentee's monopoly rights ..."
On appeal it was held by Abbott, J., on behalf of the Supreme Court of Canada, [1966] S.C.R. 313, at 319, as follows:
"... In my view the purpose of s. 41(3) is clear. Shortly stated it is this. No absolute monopoly can be obtained in a process for the production of food or medicine. On the contrary Parliament intended that, in the public interest, there should be competition in the production and marketing of such products produced by a patented process, in order that as the section states, they may be 'available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the inventor due reward for the research leading to the invention' ..."
Similarly, in Eli Lilly and Company v. S & U Chemicals Limited, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 536; 9 N.R. 91, at 545 S.C.R., a case involving section 41(4), Pigeon, J., writing for a majority of the court referred to
"... the legislative policy behind compulsory licencing namely, to avoid any practical monopoly of the manufacture of drugs by patented processes and to foster competition."
[43]
On the face of the legislation, as interpreted by the courts, its object then is clearly to avoid a monopoly in the sale of medicines, thereby permitting competition which, it was anticipated, would cause a reduction in the price of medicines.
[44]
Viewed as such, this legislation has been upheld as intra vires Parliament by several courts.  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 158 and 161, both the Supreme Court of Ontario and the Ontario Court of Appeal held that section 41(4) was valid as being a law in relation to patents and not in relation to property and civil rights. Not long after that the Federal Court of Appeal in Lilly v. S & U Chemicals Ltd. (1973), 9 C.P.R.(2d) 17, at 18, similarly held section 41(4) to be valid saying that:
"We are satisfied that that provision is an integral part of an Act that is a 'law' in relation to 'patents of invention and discovery' and is, therefore, a valid exercise of Parliament's legislative authority under s. 91(21) [sic] of the British North America Act, 1867."
An appeal from this decision was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada, although the constitutional issue was not argued there: see [1977] 1 S.C.R. 536. This is the position which has been accepted by the courts heretofore. Very recently the Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ], declined to hear argument to the effect that section 41(4) is ultra vires, taking the position that the two cases referred to above determined the matter.
[45]
I accept, nevertheless, the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs that it might remain open to this court to distinguish these previous decisions if the evidence in this case disclosed an object or effect that was not apparent at the time of those other decisions. It appears that there was no extrinsic evidence presented in those cases with respect to the object or effect of the Act. I must therefore consider whether the evidence in this case is such as to lead to a different conclusion at this time.
[46]
It is true that the evidence reveals that patentees of medicine normally incur very substantial expenses in research, development, and preparation for marketing of those medicines. It also reveals that the market, particularly in the area of prescription medicines, is inelastic and that when compulsory licencees, with minimal preparatory costs, enter the market with generic products there is commonly a substantial loss of market by the patentee companies to the generic companies. Whether this loss of market and, sometimes, of price, renders the development and introduction of the drug unprofitable for the patentee in any meaningful way, it appears to me to be impossible to say. Nevertheless there is a loss suffered by the patentee of profits which it might have expected to make in Canada had its patent been obtained under a law which provided normal exclusivity for 17 years in the absence of abuse of the patent. This much is clear. But does it mean that in bringing about such a result Parliament has exceeded its authority under section 91 head 22 with respect to "patents of invention and discovery" and invaded provincial jurisdiction under section 92 head 13 with respect to "property and civil rights"? I think not.
[47]
It appears to me that under its authority with respect to patents of invention and discovery, Parliament is entitled to regulate patents in a variety of ways. Essentially, this power enables it to create a monopoly for one party and to exclude other parties from the use, manufacture, sale, or importation of products which are the subject of a patent. The granting of such a patent, according to the jurisprudence, confers an intangible property right on the patentee. It is probably true that in the absence of this specific assignment of authority to Parliament with respect to "patents" they would have fallen under provincial jurisdiction with respect to property and civil rights. But Parliament is not precluded from creating or regulating property in the course of exercising its enumerated powers. And I can find no constitutional imperative that Parliament must exercise its authority over patents of invention and discovery in one way only, namely to grant the typical or conventional type of patent exclusivity to the patentee of any product whatsoever. I can see no reason why Parliament's authority under section 91 head 22 does not equally extend to granting full or typical patent rights on patentees of one kind of product but limiting the kind of patent rights conferred on the patentees of another kind of product. If there is an objection to such distinctions it must be found, if anywhere, in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[48]
There is no common law right to a patent:  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  Parliament has done in this case is to restrict the extent of the monopoly granted to patentees of medicines. It was so explained by Thurlow, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 107:
"What a patentee has, therefore, from the time of issue of his patent is not an unassailable, complete monopoly right. His patent does indeed purport to give a monopoly of his invention but it is a monopoly which, because of s. 41, is subject to the right of anyone who can comply with the section to obtain the right to use the invention notwithstanding the patent. Such a monopoly is therefore not capable of affording a foundation upon which a massive commercial enterprise, not by itself capable of being monopolized, may be built and afforded monopoly protection."
[49]
The authority which Parliament is given by section 91 head 22 is to create monopolies by means of patents and thereby to prevent competition for a certain period of time. It appears to me that there is nothing constitutionally ordained that the period of exclusivity must be 17 years in the absence of abuse as defined in the statute. I do not accept that the authority granted to the Parliament of Canada with respect to patents can only be exercised in the way it has been exercised by the Parliament of the United Kingdom: indeed, it is clear that from the first Patent Act adopted by the Dominion of Canada after Confederation, in 1869, Canadian law has in many respects differed from British law: see, e.g., Fox, The Canadian Law and Practice Relating to Letters Patent for Inventions (4th Ed. 1969) at 4-5, 541.
[50]
I therefore conclude that this section, by making the grant of a patent for medicine subject to compulsory licensing is simply limiting the scope of the property right, the monopoly, which Parliament is authorized but not obliged to grant.
[51]
Nor do I think it can otherwise be characterized in any way in pith and substance a law in relation to property and civil rights. It is true that the grant of a compulsory licence affects incidentally, though in important ways, contractual and property rights of the patentee as well as those of the licencee. But section 41(4) is not a law in relation to "prices" as contended by the plaintiffs. It does not purport to fix prices. One of its principal objects is, obviously, to bring about a reduction in prices through competition, but the prices are to be fixed by the vendors of drugs. Merely because the exercise of a federal power affects prices does not make it invalid. For example, the exercise of the federal taxation power in respect of excise taxes or tariffs affects in a much more precise way the prices paid by Canadians for many goods. The exercise of the federal jurisdiction over "interest" and "banking" affects the price of borrowing money. One can multiply the examples.
[52]
If one takes the approach of the plaintiffs, one could equally argue that the whole Patent Act is invalid because the normal effect of granting a patent and creating a monopoly in the patentee is to give the patentee nearly carte blanche with respect to price because he is protected from any competition for 17 years. That is clearly untenable. Similarly, it is not tenable to argue that by limiting the patentee's monopoly under section 41(4), thus creating competition and forcing the patentee to share the market, Parliament has passed a law in relation to property. No doubt the value of his patent is less than it would be if he were to enjoy the normal 17 year period of exclusivity, but the property right which he acquires when he obtains a patent with respect to medicine consists of a limited monopoly which is subject to compulsory licensing at any time in the future. It is not a matter of him receiving an absolute grant which is then partially revoked. The original grant is of a limited character.
[53]
It was also argued at several points that section 41(4) is legislation in relation to the "contracts of a particular business or trade" within a province and therefore beyond the competence of Parliament. There are several cases holding that Parliament cannot in the exercise of its authority under section 91 head 2 of the Constitution Act, 1867 with respect to "the regulation of trade and commerce" regulate the contracts of a particular business or trade within a province. While the utility of this principle is in any event somewhat limited by the fact that it leaves for purely subjective judgment what is a "particular business or trade", it has no relevance to the present case. Here Parliament is not exercising the trade and commerce power but another enumerated power, that with respect to patents, and in doing so may very well deal with the contracts of a particular business or trade as long as the law is otherwise a legitimate patent law. Again, there are many enumerated powers of Parliament which could not be exercised if Parliament were always precluded from regulating the contracts of a particular business or trade: for example its powers with respect to banking, interest, works declared for the general advantage of Canada, etc.
[54]
Finally, it was contended that section 41(4) is somehow rendered invalid because it is inconsistent with other parts of the Patent Act. It was contended for example that because sections 67 and 68 of the Act provide for the grant of a compulsory licence after the patent has been in effect for three years or more, where there has been abuse as defined in section 67, that implies that there can be no other situation where a compulsory licence can be granted. I am unable to find any constitutional principle that limits Parliament to the adoption of amendments which are in all respects consistent or harmonious with existing law, nor can I find any basis for holding that the concept of a "patent of invention or discovery", with respect to which Parliament may make laws, is that which was found in the Patent Act prior either to the 1969 amendment or to the 1923 amendment where compulsory licences for food and medicine were first introduced.
[55]
I therefore conclude that it is open to Parliament in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section 91 head 22 to so limit certain patent rights as to bring about the economic effects on patentees which the evidence has established here. Whether the result is fair or unfair, wise or unwise, is not relevant to a question of distribution of powers nor is it a matter for the court to determine.
[56]
I therefore find section 41(4) of the Patent Act to be intra vires the Parliament of Canada.
[57]
Canadian Bill of Rights, paragraph 1(a)
- This paragraph recognizes and declares the following rights:
"(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;"
[58]
The plaintiffs contend that section 41(4) of the Patent Act is inconsistent with paragraph (a) in that it has the effect of denying individuals the enjoyment of property without due process of law. This gives rise to three separate issues: whether the plaintiffs are "individuals", whether the enjoyment of property is affected, and whether section 41(4) authorizes a denial of due process of law.
[59]
It should first be noted again that Addy, J., in his interlocutory order in this matter, referred to earlier, held that the manner in which the law is administered can have no relevancy to the determination of whether it is rendered inoperative by reason of the Bill of Rights, this being a pure question of law determined by interpreting the texts of the Patent Act and the Canadian Bill of Rights. See 29 C.P.C. 117, at 120.
[60]
It is clear that the term "individual" does not include bodies corporate. Therefore the corporate plaintiffs have no claim under paragraph 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The three plaintiffs who are "individuals" are Graham John Durant, John Colin Emmett, and Charon Robin Ganellin who are the inventors of Cimetidine. While evidence indicated that none of them has a direct interest any more in these patents, their rights having been assigned to their employer Smith, Kline & French Laboratories Limited by the terms of their employment, they are still potential inventors and the value of their services, past and future, are affected by this law. Having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , that the plaintiff there had standing to seek a declaration as to alleged conflict between the Criminal Code and the Canadian Bill of Rights, it would appear that the individual plaintiffs here have standing to seek a declaration as to alleged conflict between the Patent Act and the Canadian Bill of Rights. Indeed, in the Borowski case there was nothing to suggest that Mr. Borowski had been or could ever be personally affected by the abortion sections of the Criminal Code. In the present case it appears to me that the interests of the three individual plaintiffs in having a declaration as to the impact of the Canadian Bill of Rights on section 41 (4) of the Patent Act is much more direct. To the extent that the Borowski decision and earlier decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada upon which it was based require that it be unlikely that a constitutional or quasi-constitutional issue can otherwise be raised if the plaintiff is not entitled to seek a declaration, that requirement is met in the present case in my view. As the only rights protected by paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights are those of individuals, it seems to me unlikely that there will be individual inventors of medicines with a more direct interest in attacking section 41(4) than those employed in a multi-national pharmaceutical business such as the individual plaintiffs here.
[61]
A further question then arises as to whether section 41(4) amounts to a deprivation of "property". For reasons explained above in connection with the distribution of powers question, I do not think the effect of section 41(4) is to take away from a patentee an absolute vested right to a monopoly for 17 years. No one has at common law an automatic right to a patent carrying with it a 17 year monopoly: see Hoescht case, supra. As for patents in relation to medicines, the Patent Act has since 1923 conferred a 17 year monopoly, but one which is defeasible. When a compulsory licence is issued, it does not amount to a taking away of a monopoly as the monopoly created by the patent was always a limited one subject to such decisions taken by applicants and the Commissioner with respect to the obtaining and granting of a compulsory licence. In this respect the property rights granted by a patent in respect to medicines is rather like a title to land in fee simple which is subject to the right-of-way of a neighbour passing over that land. If the neighbour does not use the right of way for five years and then starts to use it, his use does not amount to a taking of the property of the owner in fee simple: the owner's right was always subject to the possible inconvenience of use of the right away arising out of a unilateral decision taken by the neighbour.
[62]
The defendant contends that, as the monopoly granted under section 41 is defeasible, the grant of a licence is not a "deprivation" of property as referred to in paragraph 1(a) of the Bill of Rights. I have concluded, however, that the process of the grant of a compulsory licence and the fixing of its terms do have the effect of determining when and under what conditions the exclusivity initially granted by a medical patent is to be terminated. This involves the definition or scope of one of the bundle of rights involved in the grant of a patent and is therefore a decision about property rights. The effect of a determination that the conditions prescribed by section 41(4) for the issue of a compulsory licence have been met is to thereby permit the impairment of the initial monopoly. To give the Canadian Bill of Rights the liberal interpretation advocated by the plaintiffs, and which I think is correct, it is appropriate to regard this as a "deprivation of property". If one were to adopt the narrower view of "deprive" as it appears in paragraph 1(a), it would mean that any advantage which is terminable at the discretion of an official cannot result in a deprivation so as to attract the safeguards of paragraph 1(a) of the Bill of Rights or section 7 of the Charter. This would mean, for example, that as parole is a privilege revocable by the Parole Board, its refusal or revocation is not a deprivation of "liberty" and can be effected without regard to these provisions. I have rejected this proposition elsewhere: see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  section 41(4) is in accordance with "due process of law". The plaintiffs contend that "due process" has both a substantive and a procedural content. They further contend that substantive due process is denied because the effect of section 41(4) is to give the benefits of the property of A to B without adequate compensation. It is said that section 41(4) by its very structure precludes adequate compensation in directing the Commissioner to have regard to making the drug available "at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the patentee
due reward for the research leading to the invention
" (emphasis added). By confining consideration only to the research leading to the invention, it is said, the Commissioner cannot order a royalty which is compensatory because this excludes the costs of all the research leading to inventions which are unsuccessful and which must be retrieved from profits of successful inventions, and it excludes post-research costs necessarily incurred to reach the stage of marketing. Further, it is argued that section 41(4) as it has been interpreted by the courts denies procedural due process because it allows the Commissioner to determine his own procedure which is arbitrary and to fix royalties without regard to pertinent information.
[64]
This argument raises the difficult question as to whether "due process" as referred to in paragraph 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights has a substantive content. This question has never been clearly and determinatively answered by the higher courts but such authority as there is militates against "due process" being given a substantive content.
[65]
The issue was addressed at length by the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  where it was argued that mandatory breath tests prescribed under the Criminal Code for persons suspected of drunken or impaired driving involved a denial of "due process" under the Canadian Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court of Canada rejected this contention. Laskin, J., writing for the majority, while leaving open the possibility that "due process" might some day be given a substantive content, in his reasoning gave ample indication that such a step would be highly questionable. In particular he emphasized that the Canadian Bill of Rights is only a statutory guide to the interpretation of federal legislation and not a constitutional directive. He also emphasized the difficulties which courts would have, in the absence of established criteria for substantive due process, in passing judgment on the propriety of legislation. At pages 899-900 he said:
"... Assuming that 'except by due process of law' provides a means of controlling substantive federal legislation - a point that did not directly arise in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (as contrasted with a constitutional) jurisdiction to deny operative effect to a substantive measure duly enacted by a Parliament constitutionally competent to do so, and exercising its powers in accordance with the tenets of responsible government, which underlie the discharge of legislative authority under the British North America Act. Those reasons must relate to objective and manageable standards by which a court should be guided if scope is to be found in s. 1(a) due process to silence otherwise competent federal legislation. Neither reasons nor underlying standards were offered here. For myself, I am not prepared in this case to surmise what they might be."
And at pages 902-903 he said:
"... Certainly, in the present case, a holding that the enactment of s. 223 has infringed the appellant's right to security of his person without due process of law must be grounded on more than a substitution of a personal judgment for that of Parliament. There is nothing in the record, by way of evidence or admissible extrinsic material, upon which such a holding could be supported. I am, moreover, of the opinion that it is within the scope of judicial notice to recognize that Parliament has acted in a matter that is of great social concern, that is the human and economic cost of highway accidents arising from drunk driving, in enacting s. 223 and related provisions of the Criminal Code. Even where this court is asked to pass on the constitutional validity of legislation, it knows that it must resist making the wisdom of impugned legislation the test of its constitutionality. A fortiori is this so where it is measuring legislation by a statutory standard, the result of which may make federal enactments inoperative."
While a more recent pronouncement by three judges of the  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 224 S.C.R.) appears to attribute some constitutional character to the Canadian Bill of Rights, the lack of any standard in the Bill for judicial determination of the substantive propriety of legislation as referred to by Laskin, J., is still very pertinent. I have found as a matter of fact that section 41(4) does reduce the profitability of medical patentees in Canada where they are subjected to competition from compulsory licencees. But I am unable to accept the proposition that any law which reduces the profitability of one sector of an industry and enhances the profitability of another sector is per se contrary to "due process". Conceivably it could be argued, for example, that a law which makes it prohibitory for an enterprise otherwise lawful to be continued denies substantive "due process". Even if this were so, and I do not presume to hold that it is so, the evidence does not establish that that is the effect of section 41(4). What other criteria should I apply in deciding, as the plaintiffs invite me to do, that Parliament has violated due process in enacting section 41(4)? As Laskin, J., pointed out, the U.S. courts have largely abandoned "economic due process" for the precise reason that the judgments required to apply such a concept are essentially arbitrary social and economic decisions which are normally the proper preserve of elected legislatures.
[66]
It was also argued, on the basis of  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (Ont. C.A.), that as section 41(4) provides no adequate criteria for denial of exclusivity of patent rights, it denies due process. It should be noted that the case cited dealt with the question of what is a "limit ... prescribed by law" in section 1 of the Charter, not what is "due process" under the Bill. Moreover, in the impugned legislation there were no criteria prescribed for censorship. Here section 41(4) does direct the attention of the Commissioner to questions of price and cost of research.
[67]
Although greatly aided by counsel through the examination of Magna Carta and cases from the courts of Ireland, I must in the final analysis interpret the Canadian Bill of Rights in the light of Canadian jurisprudence. There is very little in that jurisprudence to suggest to me that paragraph 1(a) authorizes any court to treat the substantive provisions of section 41(4) of the Patent Act as inoperative on the ground that it is unfair in an economic sense to patentees of medicines.
[68]
It remains to consider, however, whether section 41(4) denies "due process" in the procedural sense. It should be noted that the Federal Court of Appeal has clearly held that the section is not inconsistent with paragraph 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights which says that no law shall be construed or applied so as to
"deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations."
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , the Court of Appeal, while seemingly accepting that a determination by the Commissioner under section 41(4) is a determination of "rights and obligations", held that it complied with the requirements of paragraph 2(e). The court said that the Commissioner is authorized to make the decision on a quasi-judicial basis but this did not require that the patentee be entitled either to cross-examine on the applicant's affidavit or to have an oral hearing before the Commissioner. It was sufficient that, as the rules provide, the patentee be able to file a counter statement in opposition to the application.
[69]
Mr. Henderson argued on behalf of the plaintiffs here that the recognition of the right not to be deprived of property except "by due process of law" in paragraph 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights must have a meaning wider than or different from the "fair hearing" requirement of paragraph 2(e) or the two requirements would not both have been included in the Bill of Rights. I am prepared to accept that the concept of procedural "due process" is broader than that of a "fair hearing" and it therefore remains to determine whether there are aspects of the operation of section 41(4) of the Patent Act which were not before the Federal Court of Appeal in the American Home Products case, supra, and which may give rise to questions of "due process".
[70]
To do this, it is necessary to review briefly the jurisprudence interpreting section 41(4). As noted previously, the case has proceeded on the basis of Addy, J.'s, decision that in determining whether the section is inoperative because of the Bill of Rights, one must look only at the texts of the two statutes. This examination must, of necessity, include the legal interpretations put on the two sections.
[71]
As section 41(4) is, for all purposes relevant to due process, identical with former section 41(3), one may equally look at pre-1969 jurisprudence as to the proper interpretation of that section.
[72]
<FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  at 228, the Supreme Court of Canada said with respect to the royalty to be fixed under section 41(3) that it should "be commensurate with the maintenance of research incentive and the importance of both process and substance". In Hoffmann-LaRoche Limited and Bell-Craig Pharmaceuticals Division of L.D. Craig Limited, [1965] 2 Ex. Cr. 266, at 289-290, Jackett, P., said that the royalty should be something less than the price that would be paid for such a licence in a free market by a willing licencee to a willing licensor (the test adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  in fixing royalties under section 19 of the Patent Act payable by the Crown in respect of compulsory licences taken by it), but at least as much as would be required by the test laid down in the Parke, Davis case supra. He held, inter alia, that the inventor or patentee was not entitled to insist on having the royalty set at that percentage which the patentee's current research and development costs were of its current total sales. This latter proposition was also rejected by Thurlow, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , with respect to the royalty payable under section 41(4). It was further said in that case that the Commissioner could look at all the evidence before him and could also apply his own general knowledge. It was held at page 107 that the compensation to be fixed under section 41(4) is not to be equated to damages for infringement nor to the profits which the licencee might make through the use of the invention. Nor is it equated to compensation for interference with the business of the patentee. At page 114 a distinction was drawn between the Canadian and United Kingdom compulsory licensing provisions: the compensation payable under the latter was said to be intended more closely to equal damages that might be payable for infringement.
[73]
It appears that even by 1970 the pattern had emerged of the royalty being fixed under section 41(4) at 4%. In another decision of that year Thurlow, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 146, upheld such a practice as follows:
"What impressed me much more from the argument was the fact that notwithstanding such obvious differences as existed between the cases, as for example, differences in the drugs with which the inventions were concerned and in the patents in respect of which licences were sought, differences as well in the classes of drugs to which the inventions applied and differences in the levels of prices and proposed prices therefor, the result reached by the Commissioner in all cases was 4% of the selling price in final dosage forms. This suggests to me that in fact the Commissioner, having reached a rough and ready conclusion as to a fair percentage of the selling price in final dosage form as representing an appropriate royalty in the first of the cases which he dealt with under the amended section, adopted that percentage and formula as a starting point applicable to other cases as well except in so far as the facts put before him might serve to persuade him to increase or decrease the percentage. While I think it is incumbent on the Commissioner to deal with the matter on the facts of the particular case, I do not think there is any sound objection to his approaching a problem of this nature, the solution of which depends to a considerable extent on the application of the 'broad axe' principle, by the initial application of such a rule of thumb approach, provided that due consideration is thereafter given to how far the facts of the particular case indicate that an alteration should be made in the percentage which the rule of thumb suggests. There is, as I see it, nothing uncommon about such an approach in valuing more than one type of property and it frequently serves as a guide to a reasonable conclusion. Here, as I see it, there was nothing in the material before the Commissioner that could have been expected to alter the result which the rule of thumb itself suggested."
[74]
While there is a right of appeal with respect to decisions taken under section 41 with respect to compulsory licences (except as to the grant of interim licences) it is well established in the jurisprudence that the decision is one which the Commissioner must make and his decision should not be set aside unless it is based on some wrong principle or unless it is manifestly wrong (i.e., so wrong that it could not have been based on the evidence or the law). If such a defect should be found, then the court should set aside the decision and refer the matter back to the Commissioner for reconsideration. See, e.g.,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  The same applies with respect to a determination by the Commissioner as to whether there is "good reason" for not granting a licence: see Parke, Davis case, supra. The deference shown to the Commissioner's decision as to royalties is well illustrated in the Merck & Co. case where the applicant had proposed paying a royalty of 15% of the net value for import of the drug imported in bulk. The patentee opposed the licence and rejected the royalty. The applicant then changed his proposal to a royalty of 4% of the net retail price of the drug in its finished dosage form. The Commissioner fixed the royalty at 4% of the net selling price. An appeal was heard in the Exchequer Court by Thurlow, J., who referred the royalty question back to the Commissioner, primarily on the basis that there was nothing in the material to indicate a basis for the conclusion that the lower royalty was to be preferred over the one first offered by the applicant. On appeal to the Supreme Court the latter reversed the decision of Thurlow, J., and confirmed the decision of the Commissioner on the grounds that there was nothing in the record before the Supreme Court to indicate that the Commissioner had not performed his duty or that he had acted on the wrong principle or that the decision was manifestly wrong. In other words, in the absence of some indication as to the basis for the decision, it was to be presumed to be right.
[75]
Does the section, as so interpreted, deny procedural due process in some sense other than the requirement of a fair hearing (which, as noted above, the Court of Appeal has already found to be satisfied by the subsection)? In my view due process requires, in addition to a fair hearing, a total process which provides, for the making of a decision authorized by law, a means for rationally relating the facts in the case to criteria legally prescribed, as in this case, by Parliament. The nearness with which the two have to be related will depend on the precision with which Parliament has prescribed the criteria and the degree of discretion which it has left to the decision-maker to decide whether result B should necessarily flow from fact A.
[76]
It is apparent from the authoritative interpretations to which I have referred that in settling the terms of compulsory licences, where the Commissioner is required by law to have regard
"to the desirability of making a medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the patentee the due reward for the research leading to the invention ..."
he is obliged to keep the royalty below what a freely negotiated rate would be. But in having regard to "due reward for the research" he is not obliged by Parliament to ascertain the precise costs of research of the drug in question. It is also apparent from the judicial interpretations that he is expected to apply his own knowledge as well as that gained from the particular proceedings and that he is to have a wide measure of discretion which the courts will not interfere with unless he has clearly gone wrong in principle. The Supreme Court, in considering the analogous function of the Commissioner under section 19 of the Act with respect to fixing compensation for patents used by the Government of Canada, and in considering the right of appeal of that decision to this court similar to the right of appeal provided in section 41(11), has regarded the Commissioner's function as that of an arbitrator and for this reason has limited drastically the grounds upon which the court can interfere with his decision. See the Irving Air Chute case supra at 621. This suggests that Parliament has conferred a wide discretion on the Commissioner and as an arbitrator his decisions may be somewhat arbitrary. As long as they are within a wide range permitted by the section they cannot be challenged.
[77]
Given the nature of the process prescribed by section 41(4), as interpreted in a number of decisions binding on me, I am unable to say that the procedure authorized by the section is irrational or unsuitable for making the necessary connection between such facts as are relevant and such conclusions as depend on those facts. I therefore conclude that as written and interpreted, section 41(4) does not deny due process of law.
[78]
The evidence indicated that since the 1969 amendment, virtually all applications which have not been withdrawn have been granted and that in virtually all cases the royalty has been fixed at 4%. The fact that all applications have been granted is perhaps not too surprising as the section says that when such an application is made the Commissioner "shall grant ... a licence to do the things specified in the application except such, if any, of those things in respect of which he sees good reason not to grant such a licence ...". The Supreme Court said in relation to the similar language of section 41(3) that a decision of the Commissioner as to "good reason" was final unless it could be said that it proceeded on the basis of some wrong principle: see Parke, Davis case supra. It is more surprising that the royalty has always turned out to be 4%. It is difficult to believe that circumstances would not have indicated a somewhat different rate among the several hundred licences which have been granted since 1969. I am precluded from addressing this question, however, in the context of compliance with the Canadian Bill of Rights because of the decision of Addy, J., referred to above that the question of possible inconsistency with the Canadian Bill of Rights is a pure question of law to which the facts as to how the law is administered can have no relevance. That decision not having been appealed, I am bound by it in my determination as the whole process of discovery and trial has proceeded on this basis.
[79]
Canadian Bill of Rights, paragraph 1(b)
- This paragraph recognizes and declares the following rights:
"(b) the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;"
[80]
With respect to the plaintiffs' contention that section 41(4) is inconsistent with the right of the individual to equality before the law as provided in paragraph 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, I do not think it necessary to deal with this proposition at length. The Supreme Court of Canada has held in a number of cases that legislation which creates distinctions between individuals does not offend paragraph 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights if it has been enacted for some "valid federal objective": see  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; and  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> . This principle has recently been applied by the Federal Court of Appeal in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ]. In the MacKay case McIntyre, J., writing for himself and Dickson, J., elaborated at page 406 S.C.R., on this principle:
"... The question which must be resolved in each case is whether such inequality as it may be created by legislation affecting a special class - here the military - is arbitrary, capricious or unnecessary, or whether it is rationally based and acceptable as necessary variation from the general principle of universal application of law to meet special conditions and to attain a necessary and desirable social objective."
For the reasons discussed in connection with the distribution of powers issue I am satisfied that section 41(4) is related to a valid federal objective. Even though I am confined here to deriving that objective from the text of the legislation itself, and not from extrinsic evidence, it is apparent from the words of the section that the objective is to limit monopoly rights with respect to medicine in order to achieve lower prices through competition. It is a valid federal objective to create a monopoly through patent rights in order to restrict competition and thereby benefit patentees: it is an equally valid federal objective to limit in respect of a certain category of patentees the monopoly granted and thus reduce the negative impact on competition so as to benefit members of the public who must purchase medicine. Both kinds of legislation involve what is believed to be a furthering of the public interest though striking different balances between the rights of patentees and those of consumers. I am unable to say from the language of the statute that either in its substance or in its procedure it is not genuinely designed to that end. Again, in the absence of evidence there is no basis upon which I could conclude that Parliament's apparent belief that consumers needed special protection in the area of medicines was not a legitimate belief.
[81]
In any event, it appears to me that if the plaintiffs have any legal complaints based on discrimination these are better raised, as they have been, under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: the forms of equality guaranteed by that section are much broader than the mere "equality before the law" guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights; and section 15 being a constitutional provision, extrinsic evidence as to the administration of the Patent Act will be relevant and admissible in its application. I will therefore return to this question in relation to section 15.
[82]
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, section 7
. This section provides as follows:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
The plaintiffs contend that section 41(4) deprives them of "liberty" or "security of the person" in a manner not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
[83]
I accept that both the corporate plaintiffs and the individual plaintiffs are potentially entitled to the protection of section 7 because it applies to "everyone". It has been held in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> ; 19 Man.R.(2d) 321 (Man. Q.B., affirmed on other grounds by Man. C.A. 23 Man.R.(2d) 125) that "every-one" in this section includes a corporation. I respectfully agree.
[84]
I do not accept, however, that section 41(4) of the Patent Act involves the "liberty" or "security of the person" of any or all of the plaintiffs here. In my view the concepts of "life, liberty and security of the person" take on a colouration by association with each other and have to do with the bodily well-being of a natural person. As such they are not apt to describe any rights of a corporation nor are they apt to describe purely economic interests of a natural person. I have not been referred to any authority which requires me to hold otherwise.
[85]
It is true that in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  concurring, said that:
"... the concepts of the right to life, the right to liberty, and the right to security of the person are capable of a broad range of meaning."
She then goes on to refer to the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution which provides that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without the due process of law ...". She cites a statement by Stewart, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 572, who was actually quoting the passage cited from a 1923 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, ..."
I do not understand this proposition now to have become part of the law of Canada. It appears to me that Wilson, J., writing on behalf of herself and two other judges, was only observing that such a term as "liberty" is capable of broad meaning. This is undoubtedly true. But she does not adopt as the considered view of three judges of the Supreme Court of Canada that it has such a broad meaning within the context of section 7 of the Charter. Nor, of course, was it necessary for her to do so in the Singh case which potentially involved freedom from bodily detention and deportation. Reference to the jurisprudence of 1923 of the United States Supreme Court on the subject of "liberty" must also be viewed with caution. The concept of "liberty of contract", originally founded on the Fourteenth Amendment, scarecely survived the Great Depression in the United States: see Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) at 427-455. Admittedly, economic liberty has more recently enjoyed a mild revival in Fourteenth Amendment cases. But it must be kept in mind that the historical background and social and economic context of the Fourteenth Amendment are distinctly American. Further it must be noted that in the Fourteenth Amendment "liberty" is combined with "property" which gives a different colouration to the former through the introduction of economic values as well as personal values. This is not the case in section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[86]
In so construing "liberty" and "security of the person" I adopt the view expressed by Pratte, J., in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 752, to the effect that these terms refer to freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention, which views I also similarly adopted in my decision in Le Groupe des Eleveurs de Volailles de l'Est de l' <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 181. See also, to the same effect,  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  (F.C.T.D) (affirmed, F.C.A., 11 D.L.R.(4th) 387, without reference to this point);  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  D.L.R.(3d) 539, at 544-545 D.L.R. (Alta. C.A.).
[87]
With respect to the contention that property rights are
implicitly
protected by section 7, this possibility is equally precluded by my characterization of the words "life, liberty and security of the person". While there may be some situations in which section 7 would protect, incidentally, the property of an individual, I can see no way in which the patent rights of an inventor or multinational corporate patentee could be said to be incidentally involved in the protection of the bodily integrity of anyone. Further, it is well known that an amendment specifically to include "property" in the protection of section 7 was withdrawn during the consideration of the Charter by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Constitution. This indicates that at least in its origins section 7 was not understood to provide protection for property.
[88]
As I have concluded that no interest protected by section 7 is relevant to the claim of the plaintiffs here I need not consider whether there has been a denial of the principles of fundamental justice.
[89]
Section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
- Section 15(1) provides as follows:
"15.(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability."
[90]
For the same reasons as noted above in connection with paragraph 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, the corporate plaintiffs are not potentially within the protection of section 15 because it applies only to "every individual". For reasons also noted before, however, I believe that the individual plaintiffs, as inventors of Cimetidine, have a sufficient interest to invoke section 15 and to challenge section 41(4) of the Patent Act on the basis that, as applied to them now or in the future, and as applied to other inventors, it is in conflict with section 15 of the Charter. I do not accept the contention by the plaintiffs that by virtue of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> , at 95, the corporate plaintiffs have standing to raise the issue of section 15 in a declaratory action. The Big M decision is distinguishable because in that case the corporation was being prosecuted and there could be no question of its standing, as an accused, to raise any defence available to it including the invalidity of the Lord's Day Act under which it was charged. This was so even if the basis for invalidity was unlawful interference with the freedom of conscience of individuals. In the present case the remedy being sought is a declaration and here the corporations which allege invalidity are plaintiffs which must establish their standing to seek the remedy in question. The judicial policy which militates against unlimited standing to raise constitutional issues is based in part on concerns as to potential burdens on the courts of officious litigation by persons having no real direct grievance, and in part on concerns about lack of a specific factual context where the would-be plaintiff is not actually in a position to complain of a specific denial of his rights. While the latter concern in a situation such as the present is not really relevant and might form the basis for the exercise of discretion by a court in favour of granting standing to the corporate plaintiffs where no other possibility existed for judicial review, in the present case the better view appears to me to be that the individual plaintiffs should be recognized as having standing because only they have rights that are potentially violated under section 15. As this provides a means for judicial review in the constitutional sense I need not consider whether I should exercise a discretion in favour of the corporate plaintiffs in order to insure judicial review, as was done in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED> .
[91]
As I understand it, the plaintiffs complain essentially of the violation of their rights to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law on the basis that the inventors and patentees of medical patents are treated less favourably, by virtue of section 41(4), than other inventors and patentees.
[92]
This is, of course, an allegation of discrimination which is not predicated on any of the forms of discrimination specifically referred to in section 15(1) of the Charter. The defendant took no objection on this basis and I think none can be taken. It appears that the section is broad enough to cover all forms of discrimination, whether or not it is based on one of the grounds specifically mentioned in the section such as race, national or ethnic origin, colour, etc.
[93]
Nor was any objection raised by the defendant to the fact that section 15 of the Charter was not in effect when this action was commenced. I am satisfied that the plaintiffs' complaints against section 41(4) are of an ongoing nature because they relate to compulsory licences respecting Cimetidine which are of a continuing nature. Therefore there could be no objection to the application of section 15 of the Charter so as to affect any rights arising under compulsory licences subsequent to April 17, 1985, the date when section 15 came into effect.

A threshold problem in the application of section 15(1) is to ascertain its relationship to section 1 of the Charter. Section 1 reads as follows:
"1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."
If an impugned legislative provision is not found to contravene the requirements of section 15(1), then the question of the application of section 1 does not arise. If, on the other hand, a legislative provision is found prima facie to contravene section 15(1), then the government or any one else attempting to uphold the legislative provision, if it or he is to invoke section 1, has the onus of demonstrating that the restriction in question is reasonable, is clearly prescribed by law and is "justified in a free and democratic society". Thus, it can be of critical importance to know whether the impugned legislation prima facie conflicts with section 15(1). If it does not, that is the end of the matter. But if it does, and if as in the present case the defendant seeking to uphold the legislation does not invoke section 1 by way of evidence or argument, then the legislative provision must be found invalid. This makes extremely important the breadth of section 15's prohibitions against any legislation which draws distinctions among citizens.
[95]
It appears to me that by its express references to certain forms of discrimination, namely "race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability", section 15(1) is clearly intended to proscribe any distinctions based on those grounds. Any such distinctions, if they are to be defended, must be justified under section 1. It may be that distinctions based on certain grounds such as age may be more readily justified under section 1 but the onus must be the defender of such a distinction even then.
[96]
With respect to other kinds of distinctions which may be made by legislation, it appears to me that no such presumption arises of discrimination and that it is necessary to analyze such distinctions more closely to determine whether they can be regarded as in conflict with section 15(1). I do not think it could have been the intention that every distinction drawn by legislation between citizens or classes of citizens should automatically be regarded as "discrimination" within section 15(1) and thus immediately cause a shift in onus to a defender of the legislation to justify it under section 1. It is the business of legislatures to make distinctions for a myriad of reasons and it is inconceivable that every one of these should place on the government, or on any one else relying on such legislation, the onus of showing that it is "justified in a free and democratic society". This would shift to the courts a decisional right and burden which would be unacceptable both to them and the legislatures.
[97]
One must therefore seek criteria to aid in determining whether a legislative distinction creates an inequality which is discriminatory, taking "discrimination" to mean the kind of distinction prohibited by section 15(1). It would not, I think, be appropriate to rely solely on tests commonly used with respect to the interpretation of paragraph 1(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, having regard to the more narrow scope of that provision and the statutory nature of the instrument in which it was found. I would, however, with respect adopt the language of McIntyre, J., with whom Dickson, J., concurred in  <FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED>  case is whether such inequality as may be created by legislation affecting a special class - here the military - is arbitrary, capricious or unnecessary, or whether it is rationally based and acceptable as a necessary variation from the general principle of universal application of law to meet special conditions and to attain a necessary and desirable social objective."
I would respectfully observe that in my view there is no magic in the concept of a "class": it has no definition, provides no standard, but is merely a subjective concept. It can therefore not, by itself, be a basis for determining, when a "class" is somehow created or divided legislatively, that discrimination exists. It appears to me that this was not the sense in which McIntyre, J., made reference to a "special class" and all I understand him to be saying is that if a certain number of people in society are treated differently there should be a rational basis for distinguishing betwen them and the rest of society.
[98]
It will be seen that this test is twofold: the ends must be among those broadly legitimate for a government, and the means must be rationally related to the achievement of those ends. The proper test for legitimacy of ends may, in my view, be no higher than that the essential purpose of the legislation must not be to disadvantage any particular person or group of persons, even if it may have that consequence. In the present case there was really no dispute that the end sought to be achieved by the impugned legislation is the reduction in price of a number of medicines thought to be important to the well-being of the public. I have already held that to be within the powers of Parliament in terms of the distribution of powers, and I have no difficulty in finding that it is a legitimate governmental objective. The question then remains as to whether the means are rationally related to the achievement of that objective.
[99]
In deciding this issue it is necessary first to make two observations. Since section 1 of the Charter is not in issue here, the presumption of validity of the legislation still applies which means that the onus is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the means are not appropriate. Further, in judging that question it is not for the courts to weigh the evidence finely to ascertain if the means chosen are perfect or even the best available. The choice among various possible means is and should remain a political choice: all the court should do is to see whether the means chosen are patently unsuited or in appropriate for the purpose, and if not then the choice of the legislature should be respected.
[100]
As I understand the plaintiffs' submissions, they contend that section 41(4) is not a rational mechanism for achieving the goal of price reduction for important medical substances because it is over-obtrusive in its effects on patentees, and it is under-inclusive by its limitation, in effect, to prescription drugs.
[101]
It is said that section 41(4) denies a fair profit to patentees who incur virtually all the costs of research and development, not only for successful drugs but also for unsuccessful drugs whose costs must also be borne from the profits of the successful drugs. It is said that the structure of the section itself, as interpreted, dictates such a result because it directs the Commissioner, in fixing the amount of royalty, to have regard only to "due reward for the research leading to the invention" which, even if effectively implemented, would ignore other costs such as that of unsuccessful research and of promotion. Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, they have been unable to provide clear evidence as to the impact on patentees of section 41(4). As I have noted earlier, they have demonstrated that research and development is expensive (at least in absolute terms); that for an average drug, viewing the international pharmaceutical industry as a whole, costs are probably (the evidence here being very hypothetical) not recouped until several years after the drug reaches the market; and that the existence of compulsory licensing in Canada reduces the net present value of a new drug to a Canadian patentee. But all this proves is that patentees would be better off without compulsory licensing. It does not prove that compulsory licensing is overwhelmingly oppressive and out of proportion to the public benefits. Those public benefits appear to be substantial. For example, as noted above, one study put in as evidence by the plaintiffs (Exhibit P-102, document 64) concluded that in 1975 the average prices of compulsory licenced drugs were 28.6% below what they would have been without compulsory licensing. The Eastman Commission, supra, reporting in 1985 concluded that in 1983 "the prices of generic drugs was 51 per cent of the prices of the patent-holding firms for substitutable brands", and that savings of some 211 million dollars in the price of compulsory licenced drugs were achieved that year. So it is not possible to say that the section has been ineffective. Nor do I find any criteria for determining that it has been disproportionately oppressive on the patentees. It has not been demonstrated, for example, what portion of the worldwide research and development costs ought to be borne by Canadian drug sales, although the evidence did show that Canadian sales amount to only about 2% of the international market relevant to the western world; nor was there any precise information to demonstrate that compulsory licensing was denying either the multi-national companies nor their Canadian subsidiaries a reasonable return on their investment. There was certainly evidence that sales had been lost and profits had been reduced. There was even evidence of operating losses in certain companies. Apart from the fact that I have no way of knowing whether this is typical, I would have to know a good deal more as to the cause of these operating losses than the plaintiffs have been willing or able to prove. For example, a financial statement of one Canadian company shows that it suffered a loss in a recent year although of course the statement does not demonstrate how that was related to compulsory licensing of its parent company's drug. At the same time, an analysis by an expert witness demonstrated that if this company in the immediately preceding years had been paying the international market price for supplies of this drug rather than a higher price to a related corporation, its operating profits then would have been almost three times as much. As there was no evidence to indicate that the company's source or cost of the drug was changed in the year of loss in question, one could readily speculate that the company would still have been in a profitable position had it decided not to purchase the more expensive drug from its sister subsidiary. While I am persuaded that patentees who make the major contribution in terms of research and development and the establishment of the drug in the market ought to have a reward sufficient to compensate them for their investment, I have no basis for judging that that reward, in respect of the Canadian industry, is grossly inadequate even if less than the industry might prefer. The evidence indicates that patentees do enjoy a substantial period of exclusivity (the best evidence, as noted above being an average of 6.8 years). How does one relate this to the estimates of Dr. Joglekar, the expert called by the plaintiffs, that on a worldwide basis the costs attributable to a new drug are not recovered by the average new product until ten years after marketing begins and that the investment involved does not pay a better return than would a bond until some fourteen years after marketing begins? Apart from the very hypothetical basis of Dr. Joglekar's estimates, what do they prove as to the period of exclusivity required in Canada where drug prices may be relatively higher? Presumably companies selling patented drugs in Canada, knowing that they are potentially subject to compulsory licensing, may take that fact into account in fixing the price of their products while they are in a monopoly position. A number of witnesses on behalf of the plaintiffs also emphasized the great advantages conferred on the generic companies by section 41(4) in comparison to the great harm done to the patentees. Again, no firm evidence was presented as to the nature of the benefits conferred on generics other than the fact that with respect to many licenced drugs the generics had succeeded in taking over a substantial part of the market. There was evidence, however, that where two or more generics hold licences with respect to the same drug, they tend to be very competitive. The evidence also indicated that generics do sell for substantially less than do patentees. While it is recognized that this is because they do not have the same initial costs of research and development and promotion as do the patentees, it also suggests that they reflect this fact in lower prices rather than higher profits.
[102]
A particular aspect of the complaint of over-obtrusiveness is that section 41(4), as interpreted by the courts, is not constructed in such a way as to produce results with even the degree of fairness intended by Parliament. This complaint has to do with the fact that although the Commissioner is, in fixing the royalty, to
"have regard to the desirability of making the medicine available to the public at the lowest possible price consistent with giving to the patentee due reward for the research leading to the invention ..."
the royalty fixed since 1969 has always been 4%. As noted above, while there is a right of appeal from such decisions the courts have generally upheld these awards and have in effect approved a "rule of thumb" of 4%. At first blush, the plaintiffs' arguments here appear to be compelling. It is hard to imagine that a rational consideration of the factors set out in section 41(4) would always lead to the conclusion that the royalty should be 4%. In reviewing a number of the appealed decisions, however, it appears that this court and the Supreme Court of Canada have recognized the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of the Commissioner applying these criteria with any particularity. Among other things, it emerges that patentees do not normally provide, nor does the Commissioner otherwise have, any precise information as to the cost of the "research leading to the invention". Indeed it appears to be the firmly-held belief of the industry that such information cannot be provided. Further, though we have seen that according to judicial interpretation the royalty must be set lower than the market would dictate under a voluntary licence, there is normally no evidence as to what the market rate would be because there is no such market. What this suggests is that Parliament has assigned to the Commissioner a task which is almost impossible to perform literally, and he has been put in the position of an arbitrator who must bring his own experience and judgment to bear on fixing a royalty. He has never fettered his discretion to fix, in a proper case, a royalty at a different rate and it is always open to this court on appeal to decide that he has applied the wrong principle. Having regard to all these factors, it would be inappropriate for me in a declaratory action to declare all these decisions invalid simply because they have all come to the same conclusion. The amount of the royalty remains subject to challenge with respect to each case as it arises. In particular, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated with respect to the very licences granted for Cimetidine which are the subject of this action that, in these particular circumstances, the 4% royalty was incorrect, irrational, oppressive, or otherwise did not demonstrate a rational means to achieving a legitimate governmental end.
[103]
I therefore conclude that the plaintiffs have not discharged the onus placed on them of establishing that this law is so oppressive on them and those similarly placed that it cannot be seen as a means proportional to a legitimate governmental end.
[104]
The plaintiffs have also contended that section 41(4) is underinclusive, in the sense that, according to them, it only regulates prescription drugs. In the first place it must be noted that the section is cast broadly enough to cover any patent for "medicine". If it has only been used to obtain compulsory licences for prescription drugs, that is not the intention of the section as framed. Apart from this, however, the plaintiffs point out that if the purpose of section 41(4) was to make medically-essential or medically-important materials available to the public at a lower cost, then the subsection is irrationally limited to medicines. It does not cover devices such as pacemakers, diagnostic materials, etc. It appears to me that the definition of its target which Parliament has selected is well within its range of choice. It is apparent from the material before the Harley Committee in 1967 and before Parliament in 1969 that the problem which was perceived was that of high drug prices. One of the principal causes for high drug prices was found, on the evidence available at that time, to be patent protection for such drugs. I do not think that the selection of the broad category of "medicine" as covered in section 41(4) can be seen as capricious. A legislature surely does not have to solve all problems at the same time and if it sees one subject-matter as the source of the most serious problem, it may direct its legislation to that subject. I would also note that, in a federal state, in considering whether there were better options which the legislature might have adopted, it is necessary to keep in mind the constitutional limitations on that legislature prescribed by the distribution of powers. It may also be noted that certain other steps were taken by the Government of Canada at the same time to reduce drug prices, such as the reduction of sales taxes and tariffs on drugs.
[105]
I therefore have concluded that there is no basis upon which I can make the declarations requested. In so concluding, I must observe that this case provides a salient example of necessary limitations on the judicial role in assessing the reasonability, both as to ends and as to means, of legislation impugned under section 15 of the Charter. Any legislation sufficiently important to become the subject of such litigation is almost certain to have positive effects for some sectors of society and negative effects for other sectors. If the imbalance is so great that the legislation is patently not a rational device for achieving a legitimate end then a court may properly intercede. But where competing interests are much closer to being balanced a court must be cautious indeed in striking down the choices made by the legislature. In the present case, the 1969 amendment was preceded by recommendations in support of some such provision from two Royal Commissions, the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, and the unanimous report of a Parliamentary Committee. Each of these bodies had far more opportunity to assess the social and economic implications than have I, given the exigencies of the law of evidence and the rules of court. Since the legislation was adopted, its effects have been reviewed as recently as in the report of the Eastman Commission submitted in February of this year. That Commission also found compulsory licensing to be socially and economically justified, although recommending some important changes of detail. While no such body can, of course, determine whether such legislation is constitutionally permissible, I have been unable to find any constitutional imperative which in this case would require or permit me to overrule the judgment of Parliament.
[106]
The action is therefore dismissed. The defendant will be entitled to his costs.
Action dismissed.
